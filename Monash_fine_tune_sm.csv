"contrary to popular beliefs, creativity is not god-gifted. it is a process that requires a constant honing of a diverse set of skills. however, whenever a person does start showing creative outcomes or traits, they are subject to societal judgment. this accumulates into fear that eventually stops them to achieve self-efficacy. creative confidence, therefore, is built upon through support, collaboration and knowledge mining. it is also helpful to rethink something from scratch through framing or playing, to find connections that may not have been there before. sticking to this process of thinking creatively, helps transform experiences and eventually break phobias.",1,M,BENGALI
"this article gives great guidance on how to approach uncertainty which is so relatable for everyone giving the current global issues.
whilst we would like to have all the information sometimes this is not possible, and that leaves people feeling powerless.
the article highlights the ways in which we can overcome this uncertainty by planning for all possible outcomes. this highlights why risk management is important at the commencement of planning. it also highlights that adaptability is crucial to overcome uncertainty.
stepping back to take a holistic view is also helpful to see the worst that could happen and then move on.
finally, it takes about the power of positivity and the ability to switch ou minds off which is crucial to maintaining one's mental health in situations such as the current climate.

"1. i think that it is both. in the short term, i understand that every new year, a shiny new model is released, to lure buyers to hand over their cash, when their current phone is still fine. however, in terms of smartphones, apple is one of the least companies guilty of planned obselence and immediate changes. the iphone 5s, a phone realesed 5 years ago, still recives software and securtity updates, with its most recent one being march 20th 2020 (which actually improved the performance of the phone). in comparison, a samsung s7, released a year later (and still a $1000+ phone), has stopped any software or security updates, and has become sluggish and unusable. apple does lean into this 'long term investment/support' thing though, which in turn can entice more people into buying into the iphone. apple also obviously designs their phones with shortcomings, and adressses them in the next one, making people buy the next one again, but they are definetly not the only company doing this.
2. yes, i agree. society has illustrated consumption as a means of staying up to date, with the latest and greatest, and in times where instant gratifiction is easier than ever, this will be difficult to change. not only because of companies who paint this picture are responsible though, but the way we percieve gratification and how we love short term stimulates is also to blame.

"this reading is about a variety of human tendencies that get in the way of innovation and describe how design thinkings tools and clear process steps help teams break free of them. the reading has stated that to be successful, an innovation process must deliver three things which are superior solutions, lower risks and costs of change, and employee buy-in and i believe that these 3 points play a big role in helping innovators break free of counterproductive tendencies. when discussing about the beauty of structure, kaaren hansen has made a statement that anytime youre trying to change peoples behaviour you need to start them off with a lot of structure, so they dont have to think. a lot of what we do is habit, and its hard to change those habits, but having very clear guardrails can help us. it reminds us of how people are afraid to take risks to avoid unnecessary mistake, but there is no innovation without action. i also learned that real-world experiments are an essential way to assess new ideas and identify the changes needed to make them workable. it has also emphasized on the importance of engagement, dialogue and learning which garners a broad commitment to change. from this reading, it gave me a deeper understanding to input these strategies into my design skills so that the outcome would be much better.",1,M,MANDARIN

"i have read two articles and here're my thoughts: 

-5 ways user-centered design benefits the bottom line
as the author pointed out that thirdly, making a product that the customer wants is important to evolve their pricing model. 
for example, a company is selling a laptop with a lower price than competitors but with a larger size. 
for those customers who want to buy a small laptop that is easy to carry may wish to pay a higher price to its competitors to get what they want. 
in turn, although the price is lower, the price model made by the company does not work. 
thus, this article reflects that user-centred design is a way to create a win-win outcome. 

-the story of spotify personas 
it is no doubt that research plays a crucial role in the product development process. 
as we can see from the article, spotify conducted a lot of investigations on analysing the behaviours, needs, habits, attitudes, lifestyles and so on of their customers for both two phases when designing personas. 
in order to create the best product to meet the needs of customers, spotify allocated different focus group for seeking reasons for listening to music. 
importantly, i think collaboration is another key part in designing of personas, and a way to promote learning from each other to have a better solution in dealing with complexities problems.",1,F,MANDARIN

"hi xueyi, thanks for the presentation! my response to your questions: 
1) in my perspective, women are allow to choose their own way of showing their ""bad girl"" side from their personal preferences. 
therefore i believe that there is no need for the corporate to tell women what they should wear nor what they should say in order to look like a ""bad girl"".  
at the same time, there are culture and religious differences that can shift the way of defining how women chose to portray their ""bad girl"" side. 
and i second what vienna has to say in the previous comment, i can't agree or agree towards this for how this topic engage in versatile outcomes. 
good points made from both of you xueyi and vienna! good talk. 

2) absolutely. it can be done when people are more aware of the situation of gender issue around the community.

"i want to talk about reading 1 and 2. 

for the first article, i agree with the author, the big question for most of us is when you stop drawing. 
when we grow up, we stop to do the thing which is less meaningful like drawing, dancing, singing. 

however, the author points out these things are helping us in different ways, and the main idea is just to do brain exercise, in an effective way. 
my thought about the second article is even though there are many people think that 98% of the wealthy in the world were taken by 2% of people in the world, 
but for most of the people in the world, 2% is worth to struggle, and we should beware, we all are poor people, just compare with different objects.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"according to the readings, both iq and eq could significantly affect our performance in the workplace. however, when hiring the employees, most of the big companies are not only focusing on their iq and eq, but also concentrating on their aq which is theability of adapting new information and flexibility. higher aq could help a person to adapt the new environment and learn new technology more easily. in order to boost this capacity, people could try to reduce the distraction, which could increase their concentration to focus on what they should do. whats more, being curious about the new information could improve one's aq.
in my opinion, i think that this reading has strongly convinced me to learn more about aq, and taught me to be creative and flexible in the society. therefore, after doing this reading, i think i should practice my aq from now on. although iq is the ability that could help me find a great job, aq is the significant ability which could help me go further in the workplace.",1,M,"CHINESE, NEC"

"5 ways user-centred design benefits the bottom line
if the product design is not user-centric, it will eventually be eliminated by the user. 
therefore, a user-centric design framework is a necessary factor for success. 
if we are able to satisfy users, then the ultimate benefit is not only the users but also ourselves. 
these five methods and the complete development process have greatly benefited me. 
it seems that all methods are based on the most basic needs of users. 
in addition, these five methods have a similar product development process as the marketing major i studied. 
firstly, we must have new ideas and concepts, and then analyse the users. 
the second step is how to design products based on the user's basic needs. 
how to improve user's product loyalty after meeting user's demand. 
finally, constantly improve products and keep maintaining competition.",1,M,MANDARIN
"as far as my understanding, we live in a constantly evolving universe where all aspects of intelligence, emotion, and adaptability are considered necessary tools in order to flourish.

so, when we talk about which aspect is more important than the other, its more likely dependent upon the current stage one is in and its respective requirement. 
as mentioned in the article, iq is important for cracking a particular exam, while eq will help one land an interview and finally, aq will facilitate your success in future careers.",1,M,HINDI

most traditional businesses continue to operate in a more 'us' vs 'them' way, and its not wrong,

collaboration has proved to be an important element for tackling disruptive innovations, businesses are more effective in tackling these issues together rather than individually.

below is my understanding after i read the article. the humanist concept satisfies the needs of customers to a large extent, but every concept has two sides. when the designer designs the product, the design concept always surrounds the consumer according to its subjective will, and the person's subjective will has its subjective idea, does not have the scientific guidance, may be inconsistent with the social development law. for example, for an industrial product, its design is in line with the needs of people, but it violates the law of the development of things, just blindly pursue some subjective ideas in line with people, such industrial design is not desirable, because it may bring negative impact on society or nature. therefore, we consider human-centred may be harmful.",1,M,"CHINESE, NEC"

feedback is important for learning and work, but many people will react negatively to feedback. good feedback refers to feedback that is constructive and gives a positive response. it encourages people to improve work efficiency.
a boss should maintain friendliness and respect for employees, give employees direct criticism and sincere praise, establish respect and trust in the team, and share ideas and suggestions.

q2: i believe that is achievable if governments and companies around the globe are not so concern only on the cost it takes to build or set up facilities for renewable energy and start to actually care about the future for the environment. one great example are the car industries like the bmw i series that reuses. the plastic on the scraped car to create new components for new cars as well as few other brand like mercedes-benz and hyundai have created hydrogen fuel cell cars that have literally zero emission (emission is 100% clean water) plus the car can putrefy the air as they go.",1,M,ENGLISH
"in a study of seven companies and 11,471 days of creative work, researchers found two striking patterns: first, getting feedback was incredibly rare, indicating that people seemed to avoid it; and second, when people did receive feedback, it generally left a negative emotional residue.
as much as we have mythologized creativity as the domain of an individual genius working alone, almost all creative processes used in organizations  design thinking, lean startup methodologies, agile development, and more  require getting feedback on early creative work.
as a result, organisations need to provide effective feedback to cultivate creative ideas; its one of the ways for them to adapt to industry changes and competitive pressures.
our research showed that highly curious individuals asked extremely open questions like what do you think? or where could i go next with this? these designers received significantly more feedback than those asking narrow questions, and their final designs received higher scores.
so what might good feedback for creative work look like? by good feedback, i mean feedback that creative workers actually want and that leads to changes that improve their creative output.
and just as asking open questions honors the fact that creativity requires novelty, providing feedback needs to honor that same assumption.
providing feedback on creative work means setting aside the managerial impulse to plan and retain control.
second, the peers providing critiques who recognized that feedback is a subjective opinion as opposed to an objective statement were more effective in enhancing the creativity of the final design.
in other words, theres a real need to understand how to give and receive feedback effectively in creative work.
there are often underlying reasons for asking a specific question like this, including limiting a coworker from attacking your work or showcasing something youre proud of (in which case you really dont want feedback  you want admiration).",1,M,HINDI

"i found this article very interesting and agreed with natalie fratto's statement expressing that ""iq is the minimum you need to get a job, but aq is how you will be successful over time."" adaptability has become increasingly importantdue to our ever changing, rapid environment, where no 2 days at work are ever the same. individuals these days need to be able to adapt and problem solve to overcome challenges and grow in society and the workforce.
it is no longer the case where you stay in the same job or same role until you retire. these days individuals change jobs or roles so frequently that flexibility and the ability to cope with uncertainty and change has become more important. according to the us bureau of labor, the average employee now spends 4.2 years at a job, leading to nearly nine different jobs over an individual's working life. i believe this is an important insight as to why aq is becoming more important and a strong predictor of long term career success.
i wanted to explore this idea further and upon some research i found that employee skills are becoming updated faster than ever before. according to the world economic forum, 35% of the skills employees required in 2018 will be updated by 2020. this is once again linked to the fast paced, ever-changing environment of today's society and workforce. therefore i believe it is no longer enough to just have a high iq.",1,F,ENGLISH
"hi everyone!
sorry i couldn't post anything yesterday, i had some internet problems. this is what i've got so far: 
ultima thule is a trans-neptunian object (tno)
	 tno - an object in our solar system that orbits the sun at a greater average distance than neptune.
it is an icy body found in the kuiper belt and was previously called 2014 mu69 before being nicknamed ultima thule (a latin phrase that signifies a place beyond the known world)
	 in january 2019 when this image was taken, it was renamed arrokoth, the powhatan word for sky.
mission destination: the edge of the kuiper belt (approximately 50au in distance, where 1 au is the distance from the centre of the sun to earth)
mission duration: 11-12 years total (10 years travel time return, 1 year exploration with an optional 6 months)
what will the conditions be like at the destination?
it takes 293 years to orbit the sun and as a result, there are sections of the tno which may face decades of darkness or decades of sunlight. the tno itself only reflects about 12% of light and it has 'bright patches' which are areas on the surface of the tno that are generally oval, circular or straight (see the 'neck' where the two lobes join in the above image).
the tno is 43 times further from the sun than earth is, meaning that the surface temperatures are -350 degrees fahrenheit or -212 degrees celsius. there are no moons or rings around this tno and it most likely resembles the nuclei of a comet. there are only 2 identified craters on the surface of the tno and thus it is lightly cratered. there is also the presence of ice water on the surface, however it is limited and there are no signs of life as of yet.
what are the observation and research priorities for the mission at the destination?
observation priorities involve noting down all the other objects that will be visible in the kuiper belt, particularly the three recognized dwarf planets situated in the kuiper belt. the visual appearance of any other kbo's should be recorded to compare against data collected from satellites previously and currently in orbit. research priority is to gather material that will help understand the belt's role in the formation of comets (main objective of this mission). research may involve collecting and sampling various particles and analysing the data accumulated from that, however all work done will most likely relate to the occupational background of the crew member - in this case esk.

"startups initially tend to make everything they do ""scalable."". the case of airbnb proves that only when the entrepreneurial team allows itself to try to make an non-scalable change to the business, can it get out of what they call ""trough of sorrow"".
the birth of a better product is often inseparable from the designer's starting point of ""empathy"". only when the designer truly experiences what the customer needs and feels, can the designer combine the design with the real needs of people and produce better performance.
meeting customers in the real world is almost always the best way to solve their problems and come up with smart solutions.
the company encourages employees to rush outside and get some test products. when staff get an aha moment, try to encourage them to think bigger and wider to innovate and improve products with a broader business perspective.

5. suzannah is on her capsule doing research while the crew is looking from the carrier. she proves that her ability can help them approach venus. crew members gain trust on her and are happy to let her be the leader of this mission.
6. the carrier gets closer to venus by tackling and going through areas where sound waves are safe for the carrier. however, venus is too hot to land on so they can only get close. very stressful atmosphere.

"i believe that cooperative innovation is very necessary in the development of modern enterprises. 
compared with independent innovation, it has many advantages. 

for example, cooperative innovation can save enterprises the cost of acquiring new products in the process of innovation. 
as the level of industrial knowledge increases, enterprises will continuously learn and develop new technologies, 
but learning requires a lot of money. 

cooperative innovation can effectively reduce learning costs. 
in addition, cooperative innovation can increase the speed at which new technologies enter the market. 
with the development of technology and the continuous development of products to advanced and complicated directions, companies can only develop with constant innovation. 

however, technological innovation has the characteristics of high cost and high risk.

"in the 'what vuca means for you' reading i felt the 'ambiguity' aspect of vuca was relevant to this week's theme of ideation, prototyping, testing and feedback. 
as when you are designing for someone, with very limited information you are facing ""unknown unknowns"". 
therefore it is part of the design process to experiment, to try to understand what works and what doesn't. 

similar to what brink says in her video, as she highlights the importance of iteration since designers rarely get it right straightaway. 
realistically, it is a continuous process of iterating, refining, learning, and improving the design 
so that more ideas and creative approaches will arise, 
allowing the team to arrive at a successful solution to the problem.

additionally, the 'complexity' aspect of vuca stood out for me while reading the 'a digital solution is not always the best solution' readings. 
we are living in a tech-saturated world, it is a complex world and in our daily lives we are overwhelmed by the volume of information available through the internet; 
whether it is through our phone notifications, highly targeted news and ads, addictive games, click-bait headlines and fake news. 

i thought this resonated well with the quote by hong when he says ""information consumes the attention of its recipient, 
hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention"". 

organisations are actively competing for our attention by drawing from psychology techniques to optimise their ux to draw us in, 
increase their engagement metrics, and ultimately increase their revenues. 

hong argues that these engagement tactics employed by organisations can cause humans to feel stressed as the addictive nature of platforms can serve as distractions 
and often interrupt our lives and our goals by directing our attention and time elsewhere leading to procrastination and disruption.

i think for organisations to effectively design for their consumers it is important to recognise that sometimes digital is not the way to go, 
though sometimes it is; everything is situational. 

either way the definitive first step is to get out there and collaborate with your consumers. 
as they will provide you with the insights to guide the design process to eradicate their pain points.",1,F,ENGLISH

our initial work contained too much text and was lacking in visual material. 
we created a table instead explaining swift's most important qualities and provided as many pictures as possible.  

activity 2: 
our focus was on capsule design and elements rather than the mission itself, so we shifted our focus to mind-maps and tried our best to communicate the mission objectives through them.  

activity 3: 
our collages lacked complexity and contained far too much text, so we focused on experimenting more with layers and filters on photoshop and created more engaging collages.  

activity 6: 
we needed to capture more of the traveller's movements rather, so we created a couple of collages using the pictures we took and experimented with shadow and opacity on photoshop. 

activity 7: 
our storyboard needed a consistent depiction of swift, so we made sure to use the same grey silhouettes for our final poster to create a consistent narrative. 
our hybrid poster needed one element that brought the different parts of our narrative together, so wee used the collage of venus as our centre focus of the poster

"zambrero donating meals to developing countries is not indicative of shared value, at least according to porter and kramer (2011). for something to constitute shared value, zambrero must be creating economic value whilst also increasing the societal value. an example of possible shared value would be zambrero operating in a developing country and buying produce locally.what this can do is enable these suppliers to become more resilient, improve profits, lower employee turnover through paying better wages and hiring more people. this would therefore benefit not only the local community but other businesses too. zambrero could benefit by lowering their transaction/transportation costs.donating meals to developing countries, whilst a kind-hearted gesture is more like charity than creating shared value.

"1. each craft beer should bring a differentiated, unique product to the market, therefore, having the experience of understanding the process of making beer and being able to source specific grains would advantage a start-up craft brewery, especially if they dont have the available funding for mass production.  2. for start-ups, some of the shortcomings for not becoming successful is not taking the appropriate steps for gaining exposure. simple social media mediums can be used to create a customer base and solicit volunteers which could save costs. additionally, start-ups need to ensure they offer tastings, sell to onsite visitors, enter competitions, attend beer festivals and approach local restaurants. this gives them the opportunity to increase demand, sales volume and subsequently invest in development.

"1.	the basic purpose of the catheirne hamlin fistula foundation is outlined on the website as  to eradicate, treat and prevent obstetric fistula. this one purpose is broken down into objectives within the website. 
2.	the 2 main objectives are: treating the disease and preventing the disease. the two main objectives of the chff foundation is to be able to treat the women who are affected by the disease and being able to prevent the prevalence of the disease in the future. 
3.	one of the many goals that are found within the foundation is to transform maternal care. catherine believes that this disease should be avoidable if the right structures and programs are put in place. with their dedication to the cause, they promise to treat the affected women whilst also transforming the maternal healthcare landscape. with all the work that has been put into the disease by chff, the level of healthcare provided to women in need is something that has been changed forever. 
another one of chffs goals that is a huge part of their foundating is the rehabilitation and reintegration of affected women. a big part of this goal was the founding of a recovery centre for long term patients. the reintegration process is something that is hugely important for these women to then live out a fulfilling and satisfying life. in my life, i see this as hugely important for almost every illness, the time that it takes to heal from diseases can be incredibily isolating and lonely. the option for these women to learn vital life skills and prepare them for reintegration into society will massively reduce the burden on them that many people feel as they reintegrate from suffering many diseases. 
4.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lk_jxpkojg
this link is to a speech from catherine hamlin about their intial motivation and experience with women affected by fistula. posted by the united nations population fund.
5.	this video gives a perspective around the motivations as to why catherine started the foundation and why she remained motivated throughout all of the years to maintain her support. she details some of the struggles that these women faced as they tried to gain help and assistance in the existing healthcare landscape - what is particularly interesting is that the women did not feel welcome to be treated in their own hospitals. catherine also painted some quite disturbing scenes of the affected women and how they lived  one who lay crawled up for 9 years, malnourished and 22kgs. highlighting just how severe and debilitating this illness can be. with these shocking examples, she is very honest with how much progress has been made and just how far they still must go. her beliefs and passion for womens health shine through in this video and it is no surprise she dedicated so much of her life to the cause. 
6.	in hughs post, the commentary around the transformation of lives in particularly interesting. the ability for an organisation to change lives is so dependent on the support that you can gain from the resources around you. the importance of having strong resources and a continuous supply of them is something that a not for profit organisation will always struggle with, making their interaction (marketing) with potential supporters so important.
7.	transforming lives
in order to transform lives as a not for profit organisation, resources and funding is vitally important. one of the main ways that these organisations thrive is through donations and fundraising. 
a donation program would be something vital for them to be running at all times. this donation program should be accompanied by some form of online communications  whether it be targeted google advertising or social media ads.  in this current climate where technology is permeating almost every aspect of life it is important for the foundation to have a significant presence online. with being online, the foundation can specifically target who they want to see there communications and gain some great insight and data into views and engagement. 
with an increased online presence, they may be able to access people that they have never before  and successfully target their communication spend in order to most effectively gain donations. as the donations increase, the amount of lives they can transform will grow  making this such a crucial step in being able to transform as many womens lives as possible.",1,M,ENGLISH

 basically the theories proposes that for any human, the lower needs (at the bottom of the pyramid) need to be fulfilled before any of the higher needs can be met. so people living in poorer conditions might be focusing on having their physiological needs satisfied (i.e. getting enough food, water, shelter). in contrast, people living in richer countries may have most of their needs already met, and may focus on their self-actualisation need which may involve further education, pursuing fulfilling work and becoming the best version of themselves. being at this stage creates an environment which is much more conducive to creating ideas or breakthroughs.

after calculating the equilibrium price after a tax, there will be a a change in price (increase). this increase in price will be paid by the consumers; therefore the amount of tax incurred by consumers will be the new equilibrium price (after tax) less the old equilibrium price. 
you can then go further and calculate this increase as a % of tax by dividing the amount by tax incurred by the tax price. 
after calculating how much of the tax is incurred by the consumer; the remaining amount will be paid by the producers; which can be expressed as a percentage. this can then be applied to the total dwl to find the ratio of how much the producer suffers from the deadweight loss.

patanjali is the game changer in the industry, every move and unusual strategy it takes will cause competitors to rethink their current position and strategies in response. patanjali also plays an important role in social responsibilities as a model or symbol.
what are the various types of companies in the industry, and how are they likely to respond to the changes?
there are 3 types of companies in the industry including well-established multinationals (hul, colgate), well-known indian companies (dabur) and new imitator companies (sri sri ayuveda).
multinationals (hul, colgate): defend their market shares in key markets they specialised in which patanjali isnt dominating.
well-known indian companies (dabur): focusing on community development with social and charitable programs.
new imitator companies (sri sri ayuveda): focusing on social media engagement, making efforts to social responsibilities by setting up trust funding.
what is the best way to ensure patanjalis continuing success?
the best way is further strengthen its influence among its followers by social engagement; keep coming up with new strategies to surprise its competitors and obtaining more market share while they are taking time to response; developing more charity programs relating to social responsibilities; offer a wider range of products.

factor

challenge(s) it poses

political

constantly changing regulations regarding covid-19

our freedoms to meet up and do social activities are changing potentially distracting us from our work.
there is also the distraction of following political news. this comes back to our priorities, following the news might feel like an urgent task but in the scheme of things, it is largely unimportant.

environmental

not a factor that significantly impacts our ability to complete the project.

social

lifestyle attitudes



some of us might be unable to connect with friends or families due to social distancing. we might find it harder to cope with our work due to mental stress and loneliness that some of us might feel due to social isolation.


cultural

learning approaches



upbringings may affect the manner in which each of us most effectively learns and communicates. those from different backgrounds may find the implementation of social distancing and campus shut down more impactful on their abilities than others and we should aim to be mindful of this.


technological

bandwidth limitations.


clarity of communication.



sudden dependence on technology may result in limitations regarding communication and accessibility. sites and network calls can experience crashes and/or slowdowns and can vary across members. communication is often most clearly interpreted when there is physical presence, thus the main form of communication involving video calls can diminish effectiveness when conveying ideas.


economical

increasing unemployment rates



this could potentially be causing some distress for some members. as a group we should be understanding of each others circumstances and be encouraging towards one another to complete this project.


legal

restrictions on physical interaction



limits the methods of contact that we have to online only, which makes it more difficult for discussion.


micro 1
lack of a learning outcome check mechanism to evaluate group and individual work.


unlike normal courses, physical workshops/tutorials are provided to check the accuracy of knowledge absorption. this requires more time to communicate the problem and, if necessary, to ask the instructor to solve our problems.


micro 2
slow internet connections


this challenge can get in the way of us working remotely in an efficient manner. while it is difficult, it simply requires us to be patient


micro 3
it is difficult to learn online social norms and acceptable behaviour


is it okay to send 4 messages in a row asking questions? how do i apologise for talking over someone without making the problem worse?
these challenges that come with learning social norms in online settings can cause anxiety and distress as we try to learn together. we need to remind ourselves that everyone is going through it and that our peers want to achieve the same goal of getting this project done well.


micro 4
working with people that we havent met before


this is challenging especially for people like me that are nervous when first meeting new people. it can become hard to be myself and work at my best when this challenge is in my mind. as we spend more time on zoom and messaging each other we can get to know each other better and begin to feel more confident in these professional relationships.


micro 5
the efficiency of the work may be affected by unexpected problems.


face-to-face communication can encourage everyone to share their ideas, discuss any issues and draw conclusions in the first place. electronic communication may be affected by some hardware and software problems (microphones, network, etc.). more regular meetings and communications are needed to ensure that everyone is fully aware of what needs to be done and what deadlines need to be met.


micro 6
lack of motivation could happen.


workshops and face-to-face communication create a mutually stimulating environment, which has the effect of improving efficiency and quality.
in the absence of passion, there is a need to take steps such as strengthening cooperation, building relationships, etc. so that everyone is motivated towards the same goals.

1.kelloggs coco pops should know that revitalizing a brand requires marketers to either recapture lost sources of brand equity or establish new ones. according to the cbbe framework, two general approaches are pos- sible: (1s depth or breadth (or both) of brand awareness by improving brand recall and recognition by consumers during purchase or consumption settings; and (2) improve the strength, favorability, and uniqueness of brand associations making up the brand image. this latter approach may require programs directed at existing or new brand associations

"in the school where i work, i could say that the five components of reading is introduced. however, there some elements such as phonemic awareness and phonics, which are given more emphasis, compared to the three other elements of reading. teaching these elements is hierarchical based on the ages and cognitive ability of students. students in junior level (high functioning learners) starts with phonemic awareness and the level increases as they progresses academically. it also taught in pods (small groups), which students with the same abilities are grouped together and an assigned teacher teaches them. i could say that students in my school has a great foundation in learning these components, but i think as soon as they level-up, the continuity of learning fluency to comprehension becomes less emphasized. the teaching reading instructions stagnate at teaching phonics and phonemic awareness with less opportunity to explore and engage with variety of reading material in order to learn new words, develop fluency and comprehension.
in the article of hempenstall (2016), i am surprised of that idea that student reading progress is self-determined, therefore; teachers should not act as instructors, but as facilitators. this is supported by the cognitive load theory of having the idea that student working memory is working effectively when students are given opportunity to engage rather than being taught explicitly. when i read these lines, i questioned myself of how it is going to work in classroom with students diagnosed with developmental delays or intellectual disabilities. how would i structure my class if apply discovery learning in teaching reading? there are so many things going in mind after reading this article because in my workplace most of the instructions are taught explicitly. although i would say it is working in younger levels and universally supports students with different abilities, i believe it would be better if my school should update their english programs to assure that all components of reading are fully covered, taughtsynchronously and not independently.",1,F,FILIPINO

"1) this is a contentious issue that involves many stakeholders, including but not limited to the government, the det, school leadership, the community, parents, students themselves and broader society. as such, the two ideas of preserving current knowledges, values and beliefs vs preparing for new ones will come head to head within these different groups. i think there is value in maintaining a balance between the two. to completely reject the preservation of existing knowledges, values and beliefs would be to ignore the lessons of history and also reduces the stability on which society in built. conversely, to remain stagnant and inflexible to adaptation reduces the potential to further students' learning. i think it is important that societal values of the nation are taken into account when deciding the curriculum as these ask what type of citizens are encouraged by the nation. it is also important that educational theorists and researchers are able to implement strategies from improved teaching and learning. however, i think it is also important that parents continue to have some sway in the decision-making process as they are the ultimate authority on what they would or would not like their children to participate in. this can be complicated by factors such as religious or other personal beliefs but is integral to a democratic education system. overall, i think there needs to be a balance of power in terms of how the curriculum is constructed and that both the old and the new should be valued and thought about critically.  
3) school funding arrangements whereby certain types of schools receive more money from the government mean that existing advantages and disadvantages for certain groups of students remain in place. the funding structure can lead to lower performing schools continuing to perform at this level due to parental and societal demands for funding those who will achieve at higher levels. if the purpose of education were more vocationally focused, this would most likely precipitate a different distribution of funding. factors such as ses can prevent students from being enrolled in higher performing schools (e.g. private) due to the higher costs involved which then continues by resulting in a typically lower standard of education or lack of tertiary education which then results in an ongoing generational disadvantage.",1,F,ENGLISH

"i believe my high school teachers taught with the 'form-focussed instruction' approach (ffi) (pachler, evans, redondo &amp; fisher, 2014). as a pupil, i distinctly remember doing drill after drill, writing out conjugations, copying sentences and a multitude of grammatical structures from the whiteboard. while these activities helped me to understand the basics, this method also overwhelms the pupil and often demands memorising to be used, rather than obtaining a complete understanding and personal meaning.
during my early years of university, the educators used a combination of ffi and communicative language teaching (clt) (pachler, et al., 2014). there were often grammar exercises, however, one lecturer would begin informal discussions, usually about what we did on the weekends. from these discussions the educator would progress onto the current contextual topic, for example, describing different environments, hotels, ordering food, describing family members, etc. this allowed us, the pupils, to engage and 'communicate personal meaning' through 'real contexts' regardless of grammatical errors (pachler, et al., 2014). i found this to be a particularly beneficial exercise.
within clt, task-based learning and teaching (tblt) was also a popular approach. for verbal assessment, we were often paired or grouped and asked to create a skit regarding the current topic. these assignments were often very successful as they allowed students the freedom to create a dialogue that had personal and pragmatic meaning. that is, the use of language in context (pachler, et al., 2014). a negative for this approach may be how incredibly time consuming it is to create a lesson as it involves such deep reflection for all aspects (the pre, during, and post-task). however, as a future teacher, i see this slight inconvenience and a non-issue when considering the success of my pupils.

morning routine:on my most recent placement, i witnessed a grade five classroom that had a ""morning routine"". part of this routine was that they had a quiet 10 minutes of reading every morning. this was used to prepare the students mentally, as it got their brains working but also left them feeling calm and ready to take on the day. each student had their own book and they were not limited to what they could read. interestingly though, the teacher monitored what they were reading to ensure it was challenging enough for them.overall, i really love this idea!
a book a term:over my recent placements i have absolutely loved reading novels to my students. they got so excited when i asked if they would like me to spend the last 15 minutes of a lesson reading, if they were to finish their work early. the fact that they were so engaged and happy to be read to, made me really happy. we started reading a david walliams book together however because i was only there 2 days per week, we only got half way through the book! when i have my own classroom in the future, i plan to read a novel each term. also, if there is a movie based on the book, we could watch it as an end of term celebration (eg. the lion, the witch and the wardrobe).

"what is different and distinctive about indigenous education  why are we talking about this topic anyway?for non-indigenous education, indigenous education is different and special. indigenous knowledge systems and western knowledge systems operate in different ways. for indigenous students, it is often tricky to question the interpretation of the corpus based on their knowledge of their own culture. however, each coin have two sides, and indigenous education is also beneficial. indigenous knowledge involves a range of interests, such as sustainable development, biodiversity and conservation interests, business and corporate interests, and indigenous interests. anthropological research on indigenous societies and cultures provides evidence for the subject theory of human evolution and development. all knowledge production about indigenous people is still operating in a wider range of social relations that rationalize and strive to continue complex bureaucratic, management and disciplinary actions we have to admit that indigenous knowledge, like our other knowledge production , lies in the field of discourse.
what might be the role and activities of a critical thinking community in relation to indigenous education?critical thinking communities help people form inclusive educational concepts in education and respect differences. needless to say, critical thinking allows us to think about indigenous education in many ways, not only to see its shortcomings, but also its advantages and benefits. indigenous education can promote modern education in some ways, such as protecting the original ecological environment, and history. educators should strive to match indigenous education, teaching and future careers through critical thinking.
what might be the role and activities of a critical thinking community in relation to other issues?
critical thinking is thinking in a rational, reflective, and open-minded manner, so that it can express clearly and accurately, reason logically, reason reasonably, and cultivate the spirit of speculation. a critical thinking community makes education more inclusive and respects differences. in addition, critical education makes society more fair, such as fair employment.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"design:
while classrooms have a mat that is used multiple times everyday during explicit instruction time (year 3s), we do not have the space to set up individual work-desks and group-work table settings. desks are arranged so that 4-6 students are seated at each station, though the configuration can vary according to the teacher. i know a year 3 teacher who prefers her seating to be more traditional, i.e. rows of tables and chairs all facing the front of the classroom.
some classrooms have 5-6 lap-desks to facilitate students who have trouble focusing at their stations and/or require closer proximity to the teacher occasionally.
establish (routines):
most teachers start the morning with the roll, and then talk briefly about what the day will look like. the days timetable is set up on the white-board every morning before the students trickle in for the day.
at the beginning of the year, teachers explicitly demonstrate where classroom materials are kept, like whiteboards, markers, erasers, lunch-tubs (for the canteen), etc.
establish (expectations):
at the beginning of the school-year, teachers lay down the basic classroom expectations very clearly. posters with these expectations are displayed cheerfully in front of the classroom, and the teacher refers to these often as she addresses unwanted behaviour.
students sign a behaviour expectation contract (encompassing all those agreed-upon expectations) with the classroom teacher and their peers. this is also prominently displayed in the classroom.
teach:
teachers use didactic methods to teach expectations.
some teachers use role-play, books or videos to depict a visual for desired behaviour.
reinforce:
teachers address undesired behaviour in a timely, age-apprpriate and respectful manner.
respond:
teacher addresses undesired behaviour by acknowledging he/she has noticed it and asking the student what he/she can do to correct it.

"anderson makes a statement -  classrooms were built for baby boomers, i found myself nodding my head and laughing silently in one of the booths at work. i cannot agree with him anymore than what i currently do. traditional classrooms have been built and yet to shift from its established roots. as a pre-service teacher on various school visits, i have seen classrooms shift from its orthodox ways, but only at a primary school level. secondary schools are still fairly dull and dry. however, drama is one of those subjects that can instantly go from the dull-dry theory, to taking your shoes off and buzzing around the classroom (in all levels). 
i was quite surprised when anderson used the word extol to describe arts and creativity within schools. in my educational experiences (attending one primary, two high schools; plus recent time in other schools as a pre-service teacher)  extol wouldnt be my choice of words. i see the importance of drama and creativity in school education across all levels. in fact, i am waiting to hear from a tutor if my research topic can be based on how the arts within the school curriculum can heighten students emotional intelligence.
in my short experience as an amateur actor, i began understanding myself and people, through the routine of auditioning and creating a new character.

im scared ill forget my lines. i told her not to worry about remembering lines - because the audience can see when youre trying to memorise a script know your story line, know where your character is going, and you can make up the lines to take you there.

"target behaviour: handwashing one of the potential threats stemmed from the speed at which handwashing was occurring. although the task analysis and recording sheet broke down each step of the handwashing procedure clearly, it was still difficult to observe these when they were completed by the participant in quick succession. this may have potentially impacted on the validity and accuracy of these data.  participant reactivity may have also affected the data, particularly the accuracy and reliability. when measuring the duration of handwashing it was noted that the resulting data were variable and had an increasing trend. this may have been due to the participant being aware of the observer, especially the observers stopwatch which made a noise when the start and stop buttons were pressed.

confounding variables may have also contributed to the threats to accuracy and relaibility. it is not know if the participant was researching handwashing procedures betwwen observation sessions. a number of measures were originally taken to reduce the likelihood of the validity, accuracy and reliability of data being compromised. these included such measures as always using the same setting, soap and soap dispenser, the same stopwatch to record all measurements, a clear data sheet with each step broken down and a definition of behaviour outlined on the sheet. in order to increase the validity, accuracy and reliability of data, further measures could be implemented. these may include the installation of a camera over the basin where handwashing is to occur so that a recording could be made and observed at a slower speed so as not to miss any of the steps. at this point an ioa could also be employed since the handwashing procedures are captured on camera. utilising nave observers to record data from the videos would have further strengthened this investigation. the data i obtained could have also been measured in a third way to strengthen the overall value of the study. each of the steps of the handwashing procedure could have been separately analysed and a bar graph of the data generated. if this were done, the data would have revealed that certain steps of handwashing had a low mastery rate (0%), whilst others were already at 100%. these data would have in turn influenced the type of intervention to be planned for in the future.",1,F,ENGLISH
"are any students excluded? segregated? integrated? included? can you see any evidence of the darker parts of history in relation to students with disabilities in your school e.g. unconsious bias or low expectations? history you will need to draw on the reading ""inclusive education as a human right"" to explore these
inclusive education is a process that starts from segregating students with special needs to integrating them and eventually including all students into the mainstream settings (juliet, jenna, linda and catia, 2020). from my previous working experiences in hong kong, the development of inclusive education is still in progress. as early childhood education in hong kong is privately owned and rely on the market forces, there was limited support for promoting inclusion in early childhood education.
it was a whole different story in hong kong early childhood education compared with australia. with the large class size, 1:15 and tight class schedule, teachers usually have a low expectation for those young children with special needs, especially for those with the emotional and behavioural disorder or autism. with the standard curriculum and specific series of textbooks, those special needs students will be excluded from some of the class activities due to their short attention span or sensory issues. some teachers argue that the behaviour of those special needs students would bring some adverse impacts to the concentration of others. there was an extreme case that i experienced before, students who are in the six years old group would have their soccer session once a week. the teacher used a safety reason as an excuse to exclude the autistic child from participating in it and saying that he might not be able to control his behaviour and harm for others. because of this, that kid never has a chance to play soccer in kindergarten with his peers.
although inclusion is not easy to implement in education settings, there were still some cheerful examples in hong kong. some of the private kindergartens will have extra funding to achieve inclusion and hire professionals to support teachers and parents. assessment adjustments were made for those with dyslexia, for example, adding those extra dots or spacing in the drawing and writing worksheets. also, there are regular teacher meetings to follow up the development of the special need students. apart from that, i was surprised that students from the four years old group tried to explain to me when an autistic kid had a burnout with lying down on the floor and yelling. its okay. he needs some times to calm now because he is not feeling good. the child showed me the fantastic job that the teacher has been done. including all students are more than adjustments of pedagogy and assessment, it is also related to real understanding among their peers as well.
as mentioned in the reading, the convention on the right of persons with disabilities (crpd) bound regulation regarding the implementation of inclusion in australia (juilet et al., 2020). it fosters the development of inclusion among all stakeholders in the education settings. it is doubtless that inclusive education is still developing in hong kong. in order to facilitate inclusive education, sufficient teacher education and reformation of the education system is critical in early childhood education.
did anything in the chapter ""legislation, litigation and implications for inclusion"" surprise or concern you? have you observed students with a disability experiencing direct or indirect discrimination? are all students in your context who are covered by anti-discrimination legislation provided with the reasonable adjustments that they are entitled to?
the chapter mentioned consulting the students in making adjustments in their learning plan in the disability standards for education 2005(dse) (poed,2020). it is a new concept to me, but it is so true that they should be the one who understands their needs most but may not be a good option in early childhood education.
education bureau promoted the whole school approach to provide guidelines for schools to implement inclusive education in hong kong. however, students with disabilities are still facing a different variety of discrimination in school settings. for example, students are free to dress up themselves for those parties and special events in kindergarten. one of the autistic students gets very upset if their daily routines are broken. she is not willing to wear other clothes except for the school uniform to the school. because of this, you cannot find her face on the photos of those activities due to the different dress codes. similar case with the no hat no play in reading, the examples of indirect discrimination completely violate the participation of the student. i dont see the point for insisting equality in these cases. i am glad that the parent of that students raise this issue to the school principal, and they realise that some of the rules can be flexible to some extent. 
are there any implications for assessment or individualised planning arrangements for students with disability in your school? 
in the kindergarten that i worked in hong kong, we made a few adjustments in pedagogy and teaching materials like providing the different texture of materials and having a smaller group size for students with special needs in order to engage and encourage them to participate in those class activities. however, it was not compulsory for every class teachers did the same for those students with special needs. apart from that, we do have the individualised educational plan (iep), but there was not much that we can follow up as a teacher due to the large class size, standard curriculum and insufficient knowledge regarding inclusive education. all the arrangments that the school had made as part of the show they presented to the parents. it was really sad to say it in that way, but without the reformation of the education system, the development of the students with special needs is not guaranteed.

"i have been a determinist since i watched this philosophical debate years ago between a deterministic philosopher and a scholar of free will. at first appraisal this ideology might seem unromantic or lacking in poetry, but the practical lens of determinism is in many ways more compassionate, emotive and feeling than its counterpart (free will).
determinism prevents society from making value-based judgements on each other such as ""they are evil, they are criminally insane etc"" and instead takes into account the observable recorded life events of individuals, providing context as to why some people behave anti-socially. this is the underpinning philosophy on programs such as norway's rehabilitative prison system. norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world as their incarceration programs are less about labelling an individual as criminal and locking them away and more about teaching the prisoners new skills for the outside world.
https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48885846
determinism can be observed by studying the external phenomena and environment that elicit behaviour in individuals. an understanding of how the environment impacts individuals will allow us to develop scientific principles that can inform social programs such as norway's prison program.",1,F,ENGLISH

"questioner 
the questioners role in literature circles is to take notes of what questions come to mind when reading the text (daniels, 2002). these questions are then delivered to the literature circle to and the other group members answer them. as discussed in winch et al, (2020) on page 84, in order to become competent with comprehension, one must reflect on the text before, during and after reading it. this allows children to gain insight into the meaning of the text by asking themselves questions like what is the main idea? (winch et al., 2020, pp. 85).

as such, by implementing the questioner role (daniels, 2002) in literature circles, children are able to begin to become thoughtful readers. to teach children how to do this explicitly, you could begin with getting all of the children to read a small passage and then create questions from what they have read. you could then get them to share their questions with the group to encourage discussion. students could write these questions down or have them in their heads.",1,F,ENGLISH

"i think an effective way to teach children about the different roles in literature circles is to explicitly model these roles during shared reading sessions. for example, at the beginning of a shared reading session, the teacher might tell the class that he/she will be taking on the role of questioner during the session. the teacher would explain that the role of questioner is to be conscious about what you are thinking while you read and to note questions down for further discussion during literature circle time. depending on the year level, the teacher may provide further explanation as to the purpose of the questioner role, the types of questions that would be expected, and the way that this role can be used to assist with comprehension and understanding of a text. 
during the shared reading session, the teacher would pause from time to time and model the role of questioner by actively thinking out loud and taking notes on the board of any meaningful questions that enter their thoughts during reading. when doing this, the teacher may even explicitly say i think that would be a good question for literature circles, i am going to write it down for later. to engage students and help them to identify the types of questions expected during literature circles, the teacher may even ask the class do you think that would be a good question to bring to literature circles? why or why not?.
at the end of the shared reading session, the teacher would reflect on the role of questioner with the students. it would then be appropriate to ask students to practice this role in their own reading and to share the questions they write down with the teacher or their peers.

"being a christian, i personally believe that humans are created by god with the ability to act freely. faith is a personal choice to begin with, one that is independent of physical influences, but mental deliberations and experiences of a relationship with a personal god. however, i understand that others would question the empiricism of faith, but reading the article by sappington (1990), i agree with the theorists who argued for free will being compatible with the higher-level purposes of science such as prediction and control as facilitated by concepts like conscious choice and human purpose. (i wouldnt be attempting to elaborate further in this post as i am still trying to get a fuller picture of what has been discussed in the article.)
as a result, i think that free will does have a helpful stance to the scientific study of human behaviour rather than hinder it. in the case of what we are studying, to begin with, one of the philosophical assumptions of radical behaviourism is determinism. the world is lawful and orderly, and behaviour is predictable based on the learners history, that is usually consequence-based, which alters future behaviour. i agree this is useful as an important starting point for behaviour analysts to continue their work of helping learners to learn functional skills and/or unlearn non-functional behaviour, and in so doing improve their quality of life. for instance, the abc chart is a critical source of data during functional analysis of a learners behaviour. however, it is in my opinion that determinism and free will are compatible and the notion of free will does serve a useful purpose in the work of behaviour analysts, especially when guiding the process of reviewing and modifying intervention strategies laid out in behaviour support plans. assuming the notion that people can act freely when not constrained or coerced allows behaviour analysts to be flexible and look at other possible functions of behaviour, and not fixate on what was/were previously identified, and in so doing, show respect to the learners whom we work with and their freedom of choice to behave of their own volition. examples being when a child is suddenly cheeky, and maybe uncooperative, but in a non-malicious manner, having never shown such behaviour prior, or when an adult resists temptation or a preferred item, again having never done so prior, or maybe even doing so in the face of social pressure to accept or give in to the temptation or preferred item/activity. it is my view that defining free will as behaviour that just so happens is simplistic and dismissive. such apparent anomalies ought not to throw the data collector off his feet but should serve a socially significant purpose that tells the behaviour analyst more information about the learner, and further guide the constant process of reviewing support plans for the learners benefit.

children really need to be able to make predictions to monitor for meaning and they are being asked to infer using vocab., what clues are in the text and what do you know about those clues in the real word in regards to what action (verb) will come next.

"being a chinese teacher, my own personal aims in teaching chinese are developing students curiosity in learning different language and deepen their understanding of the different culture. according to the pachler, evans, redondo &amp; fisher(2014), the teacher should enable pupils to express their ideas and thoughts in another language and to understand and respond to its speakers, both in speech and in writing. thats also one of my teaching aim which i hope my learner will not only learning the knowledge about the different language, but also they can be engaged and be provided an opportunities to communicate in the original language for practical purposes and can learn a new ways of thinking to reduce stereotypes.
so in order to envisage this aim, it is important about the engagement and communication in my classroom. the biggest problem is students inability to communicate effectively in the country of the language. so for my classroom, i can engage student with games, activity or using multi media to enhance the language learning experience. get learner for the real world by using ict, photos or radio that theyll at least try get hint of how the langue flows, how gestures are used and how quickly native speakers converse. also, i will let them to use the language as much as possible. for example, when they go to bathroom or have simple request, they should use chinese to ask like calling out teacher in chinese. sometimes i can change the sentences structure to let them talk differently and think about there is a different way to ask for a request in chinese culture. these can express their communication skill and also develop an intercultural capability and sensitivity. whereas based on my past placement experiences, a lot of learner will not engage in the language class because they think that they are not the native speaker about this language or they have some negative stereotypes. so it is important that i will teach culture alongside the language. not only teach the traditional history but the modern thing. use news, picture, food, festival top demonstrate the important issue of the day in china. so student can have connection between the target languages country and the students home country. it will also enhance their respect, empathy, commitment, enthusiasm and personal responsibility in their long life language learning experience (scarino &amp; liddicoat, 2009).",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"

explanation


discussion of the background/problem statement, investigation question and significance of the investigation


in the introduction, the authors discuss the background showing the problem in the global context (america, australia, africa, europe and asia). they also define core concepts (sexuality education, inclusive sexuality education, heteronormativity, homosexuality non-acceptance) in the introduction and main body parts in order to avoid further ambiguity. furthermore, the authors present their problem statement, talking about the controversy of the issue, clearly outlining the arguments of parents, religious groups and political parties preventing the development of inclusive sexuality education. at the end of the introductory part, the authors state the purpose and the main argument of their review and outline the contents of their article.


position on the issue and a coherent line of reasoning in the argument


the position of the authors is clearly seen in the introduction and throughout the whole article. by answering the arguments of those who are not in favour of inclusive sexuality education, the authors position themselves as its advocates. the authors position can also be seen through the language they used (...it was truly disturbing to see, unfortunately,...)
there is coherence both between paragraphs and between sentences and ideas within these paragraphs. each paragraph starts with the existing argument, followed by a coherent and logical refutation of the argument and conclusion of the ideas presented within this paragraph.


the use of evidence from academic and other sources


the authors used reliable evidence from various fields ( biology, sociology and psychology) and from contemporary academic resources which were peer-reviewed and no more than twenty years old. also, they highlight that their choice of literature was based on extensive research and single case reports and literature review were omitted, which made the evidence more representative, accurate and reliable and thus, strengthened the main argument.


critical analysis of the literature and evidence


the authors provide a good critical analysis of the literature and evidence, not only discussing and summarising it but also taking into account its limitations and the need for further research.


identification of implications for education research, policy and practice


the authors clearly identified the implications of their finding in the conclusions of each argument, the implications included policy (including sexuality education in the curriculum, creating a safe school climate through sexuality education), practice (implementing sexual education program, not excluding homosexual teachers, help sexual minorities inside and outside educational systems) and research (effect of queer teachers on the formation and gender identity of students, the wellbeing of lgbt teachers, creating positive climate) of sexual orientation


presentation of work (title page, abstract, introduction/conclusion, apa6 referencing, page numbering, spelling/grammar/sentence structure/punctuation, word limit) 


the article is very-well presented and includes all the necessary parts (title page, abstract, introduction, conclusion, page numbering). there are no spelling or grammar mistakes and the sentences are clear and well-structured. however, the referencing is presented in apa 7 style whereas apa 6 is required and word limit is not presented in the title page.

"my transition issue delves into the concern that surrounds the lack of retention of students with low ses backgrounds when transitioning to university.
cultural capital is a notion intrinsically linked to the experiences students from low ses backgrounds face in higher education. cultural capital can be described as the proficiency in and familiarity with dominant culture codes and practices (aschaffenburg &amp; mass, 1997). students from high socio-economic backgrounds assess with familiarity particular types of knowledge, ways of speaking, styles, meanings, dispositions and worldviews (devlin, 2013) that are entrenched within the higher education system. students from disadvantaged and low ses backgrounds have described feelings of inadequacy and low self-efficacy when it came to transitioning to university (habel et al., 2016). there is much research that expressed the problem lying in the student not the organisation and a deficit conception that the students are the problem. when following this contention, it outlines that any failure to succeed at university is by the fault of the student who is assumed to be in deficit (devlin &amp; mckay, 2011). this is reflective that while cultural capital is a barrier low ses background students face in attempting to enter the sphere of higher education it can not be the only factor in converse with this issue.

"annies facilitation of a young adults hiv-discussion group in zambia, grates against a frierian approach to adult learning. while the goals of the program are frierian in nature by seeking to encourage discussion and ownership of the hiv-aids pandemic, on the lives and community of the participants, it fails at serval points.
primarily the failure is to do with the teacher/participant relationship. while friere acknowledges that a teacher and students will have different cultures, he asserts that the teacher bears the responsibility for bridging the divide and entering into the students culture, internationally so that a horizontal relationship can take place. annie is from the uk, the nation who were in colonial power zambia until the mid 20th century. she speaks english, and only basic nyanga, meaning she is literally unable to connect with participants in their heart language, instead she deputises a local colleague to translate, and by doing so, reiterates a colonial message to the group. the message is two-fold; firstly that her situation in life (a british, english speaker) gives her greater authority to teach than her colleague and secondly that her peers local knowledge is unimportant in this matter. the message of authority is further communicated by holding the discussion in a traditional classroom, likely set up by british colonisers, and by standing at the front of the class, in effect lowering the status of the young adults to children.
the other deviation from a frierian approach is annies handling of the discussion itself. rather than simply proposing the problem at friere suggests, annie sets the discussion topics in such a way that she is seeking to problem solve for the participants. by focusing on answers that she wants to hear while rejecting others, she effectively engages in banking knowledge for the group, rather than helping them to gain a critical view of their reality. this is further emphasised by handing out leaflets with what annie considers to be the right answers or right responses to the situation. the fact that the leaflets are from the uk, speaks to the previous point above.
when participants, eventually break out of annies carefully scripted approach, and begin to engage in dialogue, sharing from their experience and identifying gender power issues, she shuts down the discussion, denying participants the opportunity to engage in praxis and see consciousness arise. in effect, this effectively hinders participants from taking ownership of the situation and working to make their lives better. this ironically is the goal of the training in the first place.

sophie: good example of zpd and scaffolding. guides the children to increase their vocabulary through a picturebookcathy: helped engage the children through gestures with the picture bookleah: starts the structured sentence but doesn't finishes it the entire sentence, allowing the children to engage in completing the sentence from the picture book by yelling out.
vocabulary is a key concept to develop for primary school students (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). according to bridie (2001), 'students start school at age 5, they have acquired a large amount of knowledge about language'. primary school children develop knowledge in language from home talk, which provides familiarity, social relationships and creates intention (bridie, 2001). 
the three videos represented an easy level of challenge towards the young children, which is most appropriate for building vocabulary (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). all of the teachers use direct explanation (biemiller and biemiller, 2006), as they read the story out loud and engage the children to interact. this also relates to the social constructivism concept by vygotsky, by utilising social interaction to drive learning, knowledge and talk (bridie, 2001).
bridie (2001) suggests that teachers need to have patience and address different capabilities. all three teachers show interaction in small groups, of three or more children, reading out loud a picturebook. leah starts reading a sentence and then waits for the children to yell out the last word of green eggs and ham, by dr. suess. leah would sometimes lose her patience slightly, by finishing the sentence before each child has yelled out the response. bridie (2001) also explains that encouraging feedback will engage their actions and attentiveness. leah didn't respond with any feedback throughout the video, she instead continued to read the book in what seemed rushed.
in the video with cathy, she used gestures throughout the reading of the picturebook, which encouraged the children to have claws and wave. this is a good example of incorporating interaction and creating new knowledge (bridie, 2001).
sophie demonstrates the use of scaffolding well. according to winch, johnston, march, ljungdahl and holliday (2020), scaffolding refers to 'support given to students through explicit teaching of skills and knowledge, to move students to a higher level of understanding'. she gives the students opportunities to speak and extend their language. she also shows a lot of support and positive feedback, which makes the students feel practical and useful (bridie, 2001).

"in janine's story, her meticulous planning almost became an issue in her transition post schooling. originally choosing her passion, education over a higher paying legal pathway, which may have better suit her altruistic side, janine could have easily closed the door on other opportunities, in the way of 'big ideas', that presented themselves. 
by adapting her plan, and being receptive to change she was able to alter her plan multiple times, and realise that although she may be happy continuing down the original path, there was a chance that there may be something that she may be more suited to, or enjoy more. by taking some time, and investigating opportunities within her passion janine was able to find a prospective field that could allow her to blend both her passion and altruism.
having a path is a good thing, but being able to stray off that path, and make your own or find another can be a great thing.

"for activity 2, i would like you to explore a tier 2 strategy for a student who is not responsive to tier 1. you may choose to do this in any number of ways, eg:

select a strategy from the simonsen and sugai (2019) reading, or


select and explore a strategy from the tier 2 strategies outlined at https://www.pbisworld.com/tier-2/, or


focus on the most commonly-used tier 2 strategy: check-in-check-out. you can find out more here:http://www.pbisworld.com/tier-2/check-in-check-out-cico.

discussion prompt:once you have selected your strategy, i would like to you respond to the second moodle forum, describing a student you have taught/observed for whom your selected strategy would be a useful alternative to existing procedures in your school or centre. explain the challenging behaviour exhibited by this student and what data is collected by the school/centre on these types of behaviours. describe the current system for responding to this behaviour. explain why you selected the strategy that you chose for this student and how it would provide a better alternative.
there are a number of students within my primary school context who are in need of extra support due to difficulties with behaviour and who would benefit from small group, targeted social skills instruction that promotes pro-social behaviours.the schools systematic collection of accurate data from both classrooms and the school yard, continually demonstrates that these students have difficulty understanding non-verbal social cues, and interpreting body language and facial expressions during social interactions, often resulting in verbal altercations and sometimes escalating to physical aggression.
this year, we are fortunate enough to have two experienced teachers released for two days per week to customise and facilitate targeted, small social skills groups.using the school-wide behaviour data, approximately 20 students were identified as having an increasing number of incidents recorded.these students were discussed during a meeting with school leadership and the social skills group teachers, and grouped according to the specific behaviour to be reduced or eliminated.these groupings were then distributed to each grade level teaching team so that teachers could collaborate and discuss their observations of these students, and to report any antecedents or triggers to their behaviours.
each group contains 2-4 students, who meet for 30-minute sessions twice per week to participate in lessons where they receive explicit instruction, modelling of replacement behaviours, and then acknowledgement and reinforcement when they display the replacement skills.the students often role-play a non-example of the expected behaviour first and then the appropriate example after it.these are usually recorded via ipad (provided students are willing) and they then watch the clips and are provided feedback by both the teacher and the other group members to alleviate any misrules they may have had.with the group members permission, these videos are then also used during whole-school social skills lessons as exemplars of appropriate, replacement behaviours.
after a relatively short period of 6 weeks (due to extended school holidays and the current covid-19 restrictions), these students had already begun demonstrating a slight decrease in the number of incidents reported, growth in the number of aspire tickets received and increased opportunity to spend at the aspire market.this provides us with cautious optimism, that with continued participation in the tier 2 intervention, an increase in engagement of on task behaviour and a decrease in disruptive behaviours will be reported.",1,F,ENGLISH

"hi everyone,
my name is kexin shi, and you can call me emma. after reading materials, i have gained a deeper understanding of teaching and learning, and i would like to share my views on the two questions. 
in my opinion, learning is an ongoing process in which learners acquire knowledge or skills and continuously improve their cognition of a certain field. and become a critical thinker and creative learner by solving problems and constantly reflecting on what they have learned.
teaching is considered a cycle of activities. it is not only to impart information or transfer knowledge, but also to play the role of teacher's guidance: to cultivate good learning behaviors of learners; guide learners to become active learners; in the process of teaching, teachers are expected to reflect and evaluate frequently, adjust pedagogy to meet needs or preferences of learners, and help them to achieve better learning outcomes.
from my perspective, teaching and learning complement each other, from which both teachers and learners can benefit. the purpose of teaching is to make students learn better, and in the process of teaching and learning, students give feedback to make teachers aware of problems, thus promoting better teaching and learning outcomes.
kind regards,
emma",1,F,MANDARIN

(b) 'the four girls, along with other dominant and socially respected students in the class, showed a striking resistance towards the curriculum change. when introduced to activities, the four girls verbally and/or bodily expressed this resistance' (p.381)why do you think they acted in the way? how can we avoid this kind of issues? they acted in this way mainly because they refuse to welcome the change initiated by the external teacher. i am sure there may be other students not accepting the change, but they may do not have such a dominant and respected position within the social hierarchy of the class as these four girls. the rebellion also reflects the voice of other students. to avoid this kind of issues, the teacher should first hold an anonymous forum for students to discuss their concern, and then separate the girls into the groups that largely accept the new activity.  (c) the socially less respected students appeared to be torn between the expectations of the interviewer and the expectations of the most dominant and socially respected students in the class (p.381)how can we avoid this kind of issues? what is missing in this class? the environment for students to speak up their voice is missing. a one-by-one simple communication and the anonymous forum may help to avoid this issue.",1,F,MANDARIN

"rti model contains three tiers, most of the time we look at the three tiers individually, but these tiers are closely linked to each other. if tier 1 instructions are not constructed well, tier 2 will not be effective, and so as tier 3. therefore, when implementing any tiers in the classroom, collaboration within educators are needed. educators share the same pedagogy and instruction will enable interventions to function effectively in the classroom.
for ece, the majority of educators focus on play-based learning and the use of intentional teaching is low. i think play-based learning should be used in the classroom for children to explore and develop learning dispositions, but intentional teaching is equally important. through intentional teaching, educators deliver explicit instructions and concepts. additionally, before letting children explore hands-on activities, educators may want to demonstrate the task for children before they start practising. moreover, intentional teaching allows educators to review concepts with children.
using precise vocabulary is essential. when educators use vocabularies like more, less, first and second in daily routine with children, it allows children to get familiar with these words and concepts, and children are able to practice using precise vocabularies.
tier 2 interventions deliver in small groups, and each small-group intervention is encouraged to target fewer than two skills at a time (burns et al., 2012). tier 2 interventions serve children who have difficulties in learning the concept or not responding to tier 1 instructions. however, i think including children without learning difficulties in some small group interventions may help all children to learn better. burn et at. (2012) mentioned vygotsky zone of proximal development, if including children who do not require extra support in a small group intervention, through interaction with children with disabilities, children can learn from their peers and it is an effective learning.",1,F,CANTONESE

"this week i decided to reflect on a specific school policy implementation i have experienced. it centred around improving teaching and learning in the classroom.
staff were asked to work in small groups and visit each others classes to observe the teaching and learning environment and provide detailed feedback. they were encouraged to team up with teachers outside of their subject areas. often the groups were across multiple years levels giving teachers the chance to see the classroom practice in year levels very different from their own experiences.
this was a new initiative and the response from staff was extremely varied. some embraced it right from the start while others were more reluctant to be involved. the negative responses centred around impact it would have in the classroom and concerns with how the information from the visiting teachers was going to be used. some felt it was an accountability measure while others thought it was a form of performance review and there would be follow up (and potential consequences) for those seen as not performing at the expected standard. having other teachers in a class as observers was quite confronting to some staff. for many it had not happened since they were doing their teaching rounds! emotions ranged from being nervous, excited, reluctant, enthusiastic and worried.
it was important for the leadership to acknowledge the concerns of teachers, and how they were feeling, rather than simply dismiss them and impose the new expectations. instead of demanding that the teachers conduct the classroom walks without further discussion, we saw it as vital that the leadership articulated the reasons for the program and recognised the differentaffectsthe initiative was having on teachers. we prioritised informing all staff of the reasons why these classroom walks were being implemented (its a wonderful form of professional development and it improves us all as teachers). the issue of feedback also needed to be addressed because how feedback from the observations would be given and how the information gathered would be used was an area of concern for some. 
key areas of concern were addressed with staff and clear explanations of the process and benefits were communicated. some of these included: visits would only be for about 10 minutes and any observations would be non-judgemental. it was not a performance review and feedback would be given as a group working together as a group. the timing of the visits was organised within the group so there were no unscheduled observations. teachers were encouraged to speak to the students of in classes about the upcoming visits. this normalised the process and students became used to other teachers visiting
recognising that teachers wereaffectedin different ways, and the leadership addressing these concerns, was central to these classroom walks being embedded into the learning culture of the school. those supportive of the idea from the start became leaders within the groups and this developed their leadership skills. staff have enjoyed observing classes, subjects and year levels they do not teach. trust has developed amongst teachers and the feedback is constructive and therefore valued.",1,M,ENGLISH

"just like any infrastructure project, there are costs and benefits of the georgia freight-only highway proposal, and these need to be stacked against each other using an economic appraisal to estimate the cost-benefit ratio for the project. this will establish whether society is better off with or without the project.
benefits of the project include:
travel time savings  moving trucks to their own highway will reduce congestion for private motorists and trucks, and therefore reduce the amount of time required on the road. given travel time savings are valued by both groups, this reduces the travel costs of undertaking trips.
improved travel time reliability  reduced congestion implies a lower chance of being delayed when traveling. motorists and truck drivers can therefore reduce any buffer time added to their trip.
reduced vehicle operating costs  reduced congestion implies reduced vehicle operating costs of having to spend less time on the road.
environmental savings  spending less time on the road is a better outcome for the environment, for example, with less carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.
reduced crash costs  there is an economic cost whenever a crash occurs. therefore, improving road safety by removing trucks off the atlanta-macon corridor will reduce the number of crashes, and therefore reduce the cost of crashes.
costs of the project include:
capital costs  being a 40-mile road, this is a very expensive project, costing an estimated $1.8 billion.
operational and maintenance costs  costs will continue to accumulate over the lifetime of the road.
other issues:
testing infrastructure for self-driving trucks  one of the observed benefits of the project is that the highway will be used to test self-driving trucks. given the uncertainties in this new technology, it may be more worthwhile to consider a smaller-scale project to undertake these tests.
better roads  there are many projects on the horizon for georgia, and the benefits and costs for all of these projects need to be analysed to determine which one will be best for the state at large.
equity  the road project will be paid by taxpayer money; however, the new road will only be usable by truck drivers. is this fair?
based on the implementation of the freight-only tunnel in dublin and dedicated truck-only lanes on american highways using bitre, improvements to the georgia highway could include:
smaller scale project  the effectiveness of projects described in bitre were of much smaller scale with lower costs. a smaller scale version of this project should be considered to help establish early on whether it is something that will work.
other vehicles  the dublin port tunnel allows other vehicles on the road for a toll. this could provide economic benefits to private motorists too, such as travel time savings, whilst providing revenue to help fund the road. this would also relieve equity issues with the road being paid by taxpayer money. if safety is a concern, the road could be separated into truck-only lanes and non-truck lanes, similar to the american highway examples.
if the proposal was considered for victoria, it is important to:
ensure the link is built where freight travel demand is highest, that is, going in and out of the port of melbourne.
ensure the link helps bypass the most heavily congested and vulnerable (residential) areas, that is, the area towards the west of the port, near yarraville.
allow other road users to use the highway in addition to trucks, given the significant economic benefits this would generate for the project.
consider smaller scale projects. industrial areas in melbourne are scattered in different directions across metropolitan melbourne. given trucks will be coming from various directions towards the port, having one large-scale freight corridor is less likely to be useful.

i am new to the civil infrastructure/rail environment and started this course back in 2017 to assist me with moving my career out of offshore oil and gas to get onboard victoria's big build ! 
i am enjoying the change of direction and looking forward to learning about application of information technologies in the civil infrastructure environment. 

on the projects that i am working on, various technologies are used such as laser scanning to create 3d models of existing rail infrastructure that get overlaid with the new planned infrastructure. 
this is used to check the future configurations with end users in advance of the build.  
i do not use this tech directly in my job and i am looking forward to learning more about this.

"week 11:
this week i continued working on my literature review. i have tabulated a comparison of some recent demonstrated and high-profile theoretical architectures which calculate/simulate photonic densely-connected neural networks, and photonic convolutional neural networks. 
it may be that both of these require revisiting later on, with more specific values, but as it currently stands, the tables seem to encapsulate the prescient points of each architectural proposal. 
comparing and tabulating these designs took a surprisingly long period of time, as some of the papers did not clearly specify metrics that i was looking for. 
at the beginning of this project i spoke about wanting to compare network bandwidths, and i have come to realise this is especially difficult for these architectures, 
as the bandwidth can be altered by the number of channels available, the modulation rate, the detection rate, the input data rate and a whole host of other issues. 

as a result, it has been replaced by latency and achievable resolution. 
from these, one can get an idea of the processing capabilities of the network, but bandwidth can be higher than these. 
although, in most cases it may not be, as the bandwidth is limited by photodetection rate. 
importantly, some of these architectures list higher bandwidths, but this is due to spatial parallelism, 
and so it is difficult to boil down what the network bandwidth truly is. as a result, a combination of the latency, resolution and fan-in/available channels is a good proxy. 

i also continued thinking of ways to increase the fan-in of each individual neuron/component. 
polarization sensitive microring resonators were demonstrated a couple of years ago, so polarization-division-multiplexing and wavelength-division-multiplexing of signals could boost the input fan-in. 
even just with 2 polarizations (te and tm), this effectively doubles the fan-in of each neuron, provided that tunable-control of te and tm polarization selective mrrs is possible. to my knowledge, tunable control of te mrrs has not been demonstrated, whilst tm mrr control of up to 6 bits i believe has been shown. there is no fundamental/logical reason that springs to mind as to why electro-optic or thermo-optic tuning of these te mrrs is not possible however, so it may just not have been done before. 

other potential methods to increase neuron fan-in involve spatial multiplexing of signals on different, dedicated waveguides, such that each neuron has multiple waveguides. even just 2 waveguides to each neuron substantially increases the complexity of the noc (network-on-chip) design, as waveguide crossings and changes in relative waveguide length are now potentially important factors. however, out-of-plane waveguide crossings may allow for more effective utilisation of the chip area, as they effectively hide the waveguide in another dimension until it is needed. 

with a desired fan-in of more than 1000 unique signals, this is not a trivial task. with a high finesse, low linewidth optical resonator structure as shown in toward ultimate miniaturization of high q silicon traveling-wave microresonators, a fsr of 57 nm was demonstrated with a measured loaded spectral line-width of 115pm, meaning that approximately 57/.115 (this is at least 495) individual signals could be realised in a single wdm waveguide. cascaded (ie 2nd-order) repeated instances of these resonators could further reduce the spectral line-width, but may make effective control of the scaling of these wavelengths difficult, although they could be used to couple the signal onto a separate waveguide which then has a more controllable electro-optic mrr to weight the signal. this again would increase the complexity of the noc, but the tradeoff may be worthwhile. i have not seen any work in thermal or electrical control of these micro-donut resonators, but that may just be due to the relatively new field and lack of current scientific interest in, or academics working on, photonic nocs, or the difficulty in getting funding for such research. of course, as i write this, i realise that channel density is not the only important consideration. the response of a modulator is also vitally important: if these micro-donut resonators cannot transmit data at the high switching frequencies (tens of ghz, if not higher) of other photonic systems, then they will become a bottleneck, and the advantage of having a higher number of channels will be mitigated by slower switching frequencies. trying to optimise this multi-dimensional pareto curve is currently the bane of my existence. 
i also thought about a time-delay neuron, which couples n signals onto a delay track using an electro-optic modulator such as a mrr with peaks at each of the incoming wdm wavelengths. taking the logical minimum of 1 delay line, we can have 2*n effective signals incident on the photodetector. let me explain further: if the photodetector is only incoherently summing individual wavelengths, and the non-linear function occurs electrically (in high speed analogue electronics), then it doesnt matter if signals coherently interfere at the photodetector or beforehand. as a result, we can have two wdm signals coming into the neuron, one at the first timestep and one at the second. couple the first signal (comprising n individual weighted signals) onto the delay line, along which scaling mrrs exist. the second time-domain signal (again comprising n signals) will not be delayed, and scaling mrrs can be along this undelayed waveguide. this will reduce the switching frequency of the mrrs, which may also increase resolution. supporting calculations would be necessary to support this. then the delayed signal is coupled back onto the non-delayed waveguide, such that coherent interference occurs, before the signal hits the photodetector. the photodetector performs an incoherent summation anyways: the input intensity is converted into a single electrical current, so the interference of prior signals will not change the weighted summation. as a result, over 2 time-steps, the photodetector will see essentially no input light on the first time-step, and effectively 2n  signals on the second, increasing fan-in, at the cost of a delay line and switching mechanics. alternatively, the weighting mrrs could exist before the delay line: while this means that the switching of the mrrs needs to be at the time-slot scale or higher, it means that for control over 2*n signals, we only need n individual mrrs. however, this high switching frequency of n mrrs for each neuron may introduce parasitic capacitance and high-heat, resulting in a loss of energy, as well as definitely requiring more complex controlling electronics. 
lastly, i proposed an adjustment to tait et al.s a silicon photonic modulator neuron, that would be fairly simple to implement, and would allow for both continuous valued and spiking dynamics to be realised. i will attach a short explanatory document.
professor lowery has been quite busy recently, so most of my correspondence has been with mike xu, a new member of the ecse faculty working in the optics laboratory. professor lowery said yesterday (23/5/2020) that he is able to do a zoom meeting with me this week, so that is something to look forward to.

min = 305, q1 = 315.5, med = 320, q3 = 325, max = 335.

if i use the =quartile() function in excel, i get slightly different answers for q1 and q3:
q1 = 316, q3 = 324.75.
i noticed that when i plot a box and whisker graph, q1 and q3 can be calculated excluding the median. i believe this is a standard setting because when i initially plotted a standard box and whisker plot, i got the same q1 and q3 as the solutions, but if i change the settings so that q1 and q3 are calculated to includethe median, then i get the same results as when i use =quartile().

can you please confirm what would be the correct method? although the difference is small in this case i would like to make sure i am doing the same as you would for assessed coursework.

stakeholders?: little up in the air, open to eng students, student teams. woodside may get it students. makerspace will have generator users. intention to somewhat share with mada. (special projects or double degree of students).
as engineering is funding it, opening it to everybody may eat into costs

visiting the space?: not at the moment due to covid-19, but veronica will check to see if fil can squeeze us in.

slack for comms? supervisors are happy to be added, but since theyre apart of so many we should tag them should we need their attention right away.

review veronicas email and tasks to do: this will form the initial start of the requirement analysis

veronica happy to give her advice on lit reviews

some us research on workshop inductions. not a lot around induction, but more around badging, competency and ohs.

we will be updated if an on campus tour is possible

project end date: veronica anticipates us finishing at end of year, though the way forward may be a bit unclear.

"hello chris,
sorry i was ment to say that r &lt; p-i for a few instances(results in negative k), all the way until runoff coefficient is 0.04. which seems a bit too small. 
i am calculating k, by rearranging the short term runoff equation k as a function of p, i and s(i-1), with condition such as to ignore k when theres no base flow and to ignore negative k. then averaging the remaining k values. is this approach valid?
i think ignoring k when theres no base flow is valid, but im not so sure why im getting negative k.",1,M,MANDARIN
"for the progress since week 4:
i have fixed zhao's method's r/t parameter recovery, and added explicit 0-constraints to the off-diagonal blocks based on james' feedback.
i have begun investigating the averaging method (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02663) and produced a summary document, stored in the github repository.
i have also done some background reading on admm, positive semidefinite matrices, and singular value/spectral decompositions.
i have begun wrestling with extending zhao's constraints to multi-view, though did not get particularly far, since (as per the summary document) there is no immediate way to remove the rotation matrix from the consistency constraint.
in this week's meeting, there were several avenues of further exploration discussed:
firstly, the recovery from the consistent n-view essential matrix is not producing the same r/t parameters as is being input to it, and so is likely incorrect; it is worth setting up a realistic scenario and plotting input and output points in order to determine what exactly is happening. this may relate to non-uniqueness of e's decomposition, which should be investigated. it is also worth investigating the physical meaning of ri, ti; whether they are pairwise relative or absolute to a fixed global coordinate system.
investigate various ideas from the two papers (zhao, averaging) to see if there are any nice formulations of analogous x matrices for multi-view; even if a full constraint/objective list cannot be written yet. this may initially focus on n=3 cameras rather than the general case.
additionally, james pointed me to the idea of quaternions to represent rotations; this may prove easier to generalise to multi-view, at the cost of being less elegant and higher computational cost. i will do some background reading and exploring in this space.
further, the above would have a polynomial of degree 4 in its objective function, and so polynomial optimisation / sum of squares relaxations may prove useful. james has linked a book on this, particularly in chapters 2-3, https://sites.math.washington.edu/~thomas/frg/frgbook/siambookfinalvnov12-2012.pdf

"why is jakarta sinking?
jakarta is the capital city of indonesia, located on the island of java. since the 1970s, the city has been steadily sinking. parts of the city have already sunk four metres, with different parts sinking at rates between 1-25cm per year, depending on the report. the reason for the extreme sinking is due to a combined effect from the rising sea levels caused by the climate crisis, and over-extracting groundwater, leading to land subsidence

what is the challenge and how does it relate to groundwater?
despite the extensive flooding issues jakarta is known to face, it is the lack of water supply in the megacity that is at the root of its subsidence issues. poor water delivery and water infrastructure to much of the city, with up to 40% of citizens having no access to piped water at all, means that many jakartans have sunk boreholes into their properties to get their own water. decades of this unregulated and uncontrolled groundwater extraction, coupled with a decreasing amount of permeable surfaces across the city - preventing groundwater recharge - means that the groundwater level has significantly dropped and with it, the soil surface.

what are some of the current solutions currently discussed?
based on an inspection in may 2018, 56 out of 80 buildings had their own groundwater pump, with 33 extracting water illegally. due to this, a solution being discussed is the issuing of licences for buildings to extract groundwater. this would limit the number of extractions whilst also giving authorities an indication of how much groundwater is being extracted.
another current solution being undertaken is the construction of the great garuda. the great garuda is a 32km sea wall which is being built around jakarta bay to prevent the flooding of the islands.
replacement is also a solution being discussed where people are still allowed to extract groundwater, but must replace the amount extracted. this could be done by the biopori method where a hole is dug, 10cm in diameter and 100cm deep, into the ground to allow water to be reabsorbed into the soil. another method of replacement is called artificial recharge, where expensive technology is used to replace groundwater deep at its source.
there were also other extreme solutions of completely halting the extraction of groundwater and solely relying on other sources of water, such as from rivers or man-made reservoirs. this could work, however it could take up to 10 years to clean up the rivers, dams and lakes to allow water to be piped anywhere or used as a replacement for the aquifers deep underground.
another extreme solution was the relocation of the capital of indonesia to a new location.",1,M,ENGLISH

progress:i have investigated the different baseline models used by numerous few shot learning. the most common seems to be using a distance metric for the classifier such as cosine similarity. another used by chen et al. 2020 involved training on cross-entropy loss but then using a method they created named cosine nearest-centroid. this involved removing the last fully connected layer of the classifier and then getting the average feature of a given samples in a novel class. afterwards, they classify the query sample using cosine distance. links to the relevant articles can be found on the attached powerpoint.

"bim maturity levels define the extent to which across the dimensions of technology, organisation and process, the level of information exchange and collaboration (sacks et al. 2018) .  at bim level 2, the objective is to attain a managed collaborative working environment with targeted points of engagement in relation to specific data, groups, or activities as required to best manage specific focus areas. for example, sharing of object-based models between two or more disciplines. this requires interoperable data and technologies to most effectively exchange the data required to enable this collaboration.  further, at bim level 3, the objective is to attain a fully integrated working environment that is seamless and does not require user interventions to facilitate data exchange or collaboration between user groups contributing to or utilising that data.
where interoperability is inadequate, the benefits of utilisation and leveraging from common data sets is significantly diminished due to delayed data transfer between different software systems arising from the need to convert data to meet other system format requirements.  also, captured data definition or resolution may not meet the requirements of other systems or may be impacted by data conversion and bring an increased potential for data errors introduced through additional data processing (sacks et al. 2018) (cashin et al. 2018 ).  these issues present an obstacle of time, additional effort and risk that do not support the collaboration and integration objectives of bim maturity levels 2 and 3, and thus illustrate the criticality of interoperable data.

"hi all,
the brt i am aware of had full height platform screen doors in one of the cities where i came from.  the psds added extra comfort amenity for passenger by providing a good shelter type protection in enclosed environment on extreme weather days.  it also acts as a barrier from direct contact with the expose to vehicle exhaust.
delhi experience initially was to ease the traffic, but from the news it was hunted by the reliability issues.  it provides lesson learnt to other brt projects where the reliability is the key and from my observation delhi did not further fine tune its brt priority signals.  a good priority signal would increase the willingness from the public to shift the commuting method.  
theres always pros and cons of the brt system.  for the advantages, we can see brt has a more flexibility in terms of mobility in the network, they can simply go anywhere if roads are big enough and available.  brt also embraces the benefit of lower maintenance cost with less wayside infrastructures need to maintain.   for example, there is no need for dedicated track maintenance, and if brt vehicle is self-powered, there is no need to include substations and catenary systems.  the size of brt maintenance depot is also smaller compare to light rails depots, which can see as an advantage for places that need to fight for land use.  the overall maintenance of the brt vehicle  is also cheaper considering the steel wheels cost more than rubber tires and the steel wheels are non-permanent assets they still require re-profiling from time to time until a new set is being put on.
light rail is limited to its guided tracks which may seem a disadvantage in terms of mobility, but there is an advantage if we look at it from a slightly different point of view.  the limitation of the guideway means the road users would know exactly where the light rail vehicles are - staying on its track.  except for derailing scenarios which dont normally occur, the majority of the time we know exactly where and how the light rail vehicles would move.  on normal road, if a safe distance is setup between the light rail vehicle to other vehicles, the drivers of other vehicles would behave differently compare to next to a bus.  also, if the town centre planning decided to introduce a pedestrian only zone, a guided rail system would benefit as we can easily setup a  safety clearance area for the light rail vehicle to travel.  moreover, lrt is preferable these days as we see more vehicles are equipped with on-board batteries which can power in between stations without the overhead catenary wires or embedded induction loops.  some of them se lithium ion batteries and some of them use super capacitors.  this can tidy up the looks of our city landscape.",1,M,MANDARIN

"this week my focus was on two tasks:

creating quantifiable measures for a voc sensors performance.

designing a pcb for the mimic head for the new electronics design for the atmo biosciences capsule.

creating the frameworks for several quantifiable measures of a voc sensor's performance and coding tools which calculated these results. 

in order to better characterise the performance of different voc sensors i have been tasked with developing quantifiable performance measures which allow a device's performance to be evaluated numerically rather than requiring a human interpretation.

the three measures which i have developed are:

repeatability

see previous discussions about repeatability matrices. repeatability summarizes these matrices into a single value.

step drift

step response

whilst these measures are not at the core of my project (pid control for constant voc sensor heater temperature) they will provide an important framework for assessing the performance of voc sensors once pid control has been established.

step drift - how stable is a voc sensor within a specific gas step?

the gradient curve of the voc 50.00 response within each gas step is calculated.

note: analysis only included gas steps which had 0% hydrogen or 0.1% hydrogen as sensor stability was much lower in these gas steps, and these steps also occur towards the beginning of the calibration cycle.


gradient is calculated as (change in voc reading) / (change in time (seconds)). i.e. adc units / second.
for example, this is the gradient of the 2nd gas step for capsule 24 is shown below:

the first 15 minutes of the gas step are excluded from analysis to decouple the sensor response to a gas change from the drift within a step.

the average gradient of all gradients within a gas step excluding the first 15 mins is calculated as is the standard deviation of all gradients within this gas step. the result is two tables for each capsule.

gas states / mean gradients

in this table, the first entry 0.020906 represents the mean gradient of the gradient shown in the graph above for all measurements after the first 15mins (in 1.c.)

gas states / standard deviation





once this table has been created, the values are averaged to create two values which represent step drift for a capsule.

mean step drift = average(abs(mean step drift gradients)) e.g. for capsule 24 this is 0.053.


mean standard deviation = stddev.p(step drift standard deviations) e.g. for capsule 24 this is 0.266.


step response
step response is aiming to measure how quickly a capsule is responding to a gas step change.
note: this analysis includes all gas steps, not just steps where h2 is 0% or 0.1% as was the case during the step drift calculation. data was however filtered to remove any rows which did not have gas state data or within which all gas channels were set to 0.
1.   the gradient is calculated for each gas step
a.   an example step gradient:

b.   next the mean and standard deviation of each gas step gradient are calculated. the mean and standard deviation are used to determine the values which sit outside +-1.6 std deviations from the mean.
c.   the last measurement which falls outside of this envelope is noted. the time between this measurement and the first measurement within the gas step is deemed the response time for that gas step.
i.
ii.in this case, the response time is 0 as the gradient never leaves +-1.6 std deviations from the mean. (not the y axis scale).

d.   the response times for each gas step are averaged to determine a step response time measure for a capsule.
designing a pcb for the mimic head for the new electronics design for the atmo biosciences capsule.
currently a new version of the electronics is being developed for the atmo capsule. in order to test the new design the electronics are first assembled in a development board format. the board that i have designed (called a mimic head) houses several different sensors and provides a platform for these sensors to be tested in the rmit gas lab. the mimic head is designed to be plugged into the development board and provide a platform for various gas sensors to be housed and exposed to the testing gas stream. whilst this board is not directly related to my project, it will ensure that the pid control for constant temperature on the voc sensor heater will be able to be tested and developed on the new version of the electronics. 
the sensor board is quite small (17mm diameter) and has been designed to have the potential to mount 5 different gas sensors and a temperature and humidity sensor. as demonstrated in the figure below, this design is quite space constrained - so it was quite a challenge to complete the layout. this was also the first time i have used altium - it was great to get some experience using a tool which is so prevalent in industry. 
one of the challenges associated with this design is that the pin out of the posifa tcd sensor which is being used in the capsule hardware has changed between different revisions of the sensor. consequently the board that i have designed includes 0 ohm resistor banks which, depending on the load configuration, allow either sensor pin out to be used. 
the board layout: 
the overall design. the sensor board is connected to a connector by a long flexible pcb segment.

i think that one of the ways that bim improves decision-making is when the bim model saved in a common data environment (cde) acts as a single source of truth for all disciplines. in cad models, one finds that information is 'siloed' in different discipline drawings, specifications and schedules for example architectural, structural, mechanical etc. so if a construction team or asset management team would like to find out information about an asset, they have to look for that information from different sources which range from drawings, specifications and schedules and these would be saved in different locations. with bim all the data is stored in a common data environment (cde) and that makes it easy to retrieve and aid decision-making.",1,F,ENGLISH
"hi everyone, 
my name is justine and i am project manager with transport for nsw (although currently on maternity leave). my work is largely focused on traffic management and coordination of major infrastructure projects currently being constructed across the sydney metropolitan area. economics plays a great part in the pricing of fares based on the demand / need for public transport and roadways, and working out demand to enable adequate supply so first and foremost my interest lies in trying to get a better understanding of those processes - i dare say these would both play a big part in understanding what things are worth funding and what isn't! nevertheless, a general understanding of economics in the transport sector would be great to obtain.
looking forward to learning about this and getting to know you all a little over the semester.

"why is the west gate tunnel in melbourne delayed?
the west gate tunnel is currently being built in melbourne and is designed to be a 4km toll road which will link the west gate freeway at yarraville to the port of melbourne. two tunnel boring machines were being used to construct the tunnel however construction has been delayed due to the discovery of contaminated soil.

what is the challenge and how does it relate to groundwater?
soil beneath the west gate tunnel is contaminated with chemicals including pfas and asbestos. these substances are waste from historical industrial action. after the tunnel boring machine starts digging dirt and rock, all the contaminated soil has to be separated and safely stored on site before transported to treatment facilities yet the treatment plants are not capable of handling large amounts of contaminated soil. the discovery of the chemical waste from the industrial works to the soil beneath west gate tunnel shows that they flow through the soil and could possibly be carried by the groundwater.

solutions?
possible solutions include;

multiple large scale storage facilities may be needed to store the soil


the soil can be transported to treatment plants to remove the chemicals - however currently these facilities dont have enough capacity to handle the influx of soil


an enormous new landfill site could be created and lined with specific fabric to store the soil.

"facts always beat insults
this opinion piece, written by andrew bolt, is a direct response to an article written by tim flannery (chief councillor at the climate council), and serves as almost an attack. bolt completely dismisses flannerys article as the death of reason, and labels flannerys overall contribution to the climate discussion as an extraordinary record of false claims.
bolt makes it very clear from the outset that he does not buy into claims about the possible extreme negative impacts that climate change and global warming can have, and makes what could be classified as an attack on tim flannery and his scientific work. bolt completely dismisses climate science as alarmist and instead prioritises what he thinks and believes about what will happen, regardless of scientific backing.
bolts article is outstandingly biased, and shows how extremely entrenched he is in his hard-line denial of the impact of climate change. statistics and arguments are cherry-picked to support his view, ignoring the further context and any facts that dont support his opinion. this serves to completely alienate readers against the broader message put forward by scientists and ngos that climate change is an emergency that requires immediate action. he also misquotes and overstates comments made against him by flannery, interpreting comments labelling him as a climate predator as being (likened) to a paedophile. this misrepresentation of flannerys points presents bolt as the victim, further dismissing the article he is responding to.
whilst bolt does present statistics that are generally factual, they are presented in a manner that seems to completely prove his point, instead of exploring the reasons behind. predictions of future trends are hinged on their immediate outcomes, citing a decrease in cyclones from 2015 to 2016 as proof that cyclones have not occurred more frequently in the future. furthermore, bolt condemns the desalination plants build on flannerys recommendation as a failure, despite them future-proofing australias freshwater supply. he also rubbishes claims that pacific islands would be drowned by rising sea levels, referencing that fact that tuvalus overall size has increased by 2.9 percent. rmit abc fact check determined that whilst these claims are true, the reason for the increase in size is not due to sea level changes, but rather due to sedimentation. in truth, tuvalus sea level has risen 15cm in the past 4 decades, and the future possibility of mass loss is unclear, especially in places like the solomon islands where the sea level has risen 7-10mm per year over 1994-2014. whilst the article does contain some facts and statistical analysis, to say that it accurately considered the technical and scientific issues involved would be a stretch.
bolt does not attempt to present a reasoned and balanced analysis, rather opting to completely dismiss any predictions or scientific analysis that does not back his view that climate change is not at all a problem. he deliberately focusses on the shortcomings of predictions of possible outcomes, and omits anything that would counter his claims.

frequency in the grid must be kept constant
in australia electricity is provided at 50 hz
when you turn on a light, overall frequency drops a little bit, so more energy must be provided to the grid to keep the electricity supply at 50 hz
inertia is the ability of an electrical supply system to keep electricity at a constant frequency, by starting or stopping generation in real time, in response to how much electricity is being used
inertia should come from sources that are easily switched on and off, like nuclear or hydro

"what is the the great artesian basin?
the great artesian basin is an extremely large aquifer under the australian landmass. it covers around 22% of the area of the australian continent and spans across four states and territories. sandstone, existing beneath sea level, was pushed upwards during the formation of the australian continent. this sandstone was itself saturated with seawater, and was then covered over by impermeable geological layers. a large body of water was therefore contained under the ground surface through these areas- this is the source of the observed salinity in the water.
many mines and regional communities draw on the aquifer as a water source. proper management of the aquifer involves staggering use in order to maintain positive pressure - reducing the cost and effort of pumping water into communities and mining operations. the aquifer is recharged via the entry of freshwater, which enters through a relatively small recharge zone in nsw and qld, and typically flows towards the south and west. this process is very slow in comparison to the very large intake of seawater that occurred during the aquifers formation.
early in the 20th century, it became evident that water pressure in the great artesian basin was dissipating due to large-scale tapping/borehole drilling. to combat the increasing depletion that was occurring in the basin, the government introduced regulation to improve the use of uncontrolled extraction of groundwater. this involved the upgrading of obsolete bore systems, retiring unnecessary pumps and improvement of the water flow network. proper use and interaction with the basin is outlined in the great artesian basin strategic management plan 2018. this initiative resulted in a significant reduction in water consumption from the basin per year.
misuse of the basin, aside from causing losses in water availability, is responsible for the spread of pests in the landscape, as well as increasing salinity surface level water and land mass.
why is the west gate tunnel in melbourne delayed
the tunneling of the west gate tunnel has been delayed due to the soil contamination with a chemical such as asbestos and pfas that shut down the fiskville cfa training college.the tunnel boring machines digging up the thousands of cubic metres of dirt and rock would require any contaminated soil to be separated and safely stored on site before being transported. as a result, the delay would be due to this process in culmination with the issue that the treatment plants currently do not have the capacity to handle the large amount of contaminated soil expected to come their way.
this has relevance to groundwater as there are geotechnical investigations that have to be conducted before the drilling of the tunnel and hence, would involve the testing of samples and perhaps a groundwater monitoring well installed for the collection and measurement of groundwater levels. a solution to this issue would be to drill deeper in order to avoid the contaminated soil. however, this in itself poses other problems.
why is jarkarta sinking?
60% of jarkarta residents use groundwater as a source of water. the dramatic rate at which jarkarta is sinking is partly due to the excessive extraction of groundwater for use as drinking water, bathing and other everyday purposes by city dwellers. as a result, individuals there have no choice but to resort to pumping water from aquifers deep underground. when this groundwater is pumped out, the land above sinks, leading to land subsidence, causing infrastructure to sink. this could cause floods to become worse as the water can't flow into the ocean. in some places in jarkarta, it has sunk by up to 4m since 1970.
solutions would include halting all groundwater extraction and solely rely on other sources of water such rain or river water or piped water from man-made reservoirs. jarkarta must do this by 2050 to avoid major subsidence.

"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-shifting-from-fossil-fuels-to-cleaner-alternatives-will-require-fossil-fuels/
critique of ""why shifting from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives will require fossil fuels""
in the article published on the 29th of june, 2011, david biello strongly dismisses the possibility of a ""clean revolution"" that requires no ""greenhouse gas-emitting, mountain-levelling, air-polluting, fossil-fuel burning way of life"" using expert's opinions. biello believes that emerging towards a clean revolution is impractical and naive, as ""fossil fuel energy is so cheap"". he supported his ostensible statement with vaclav smil's expert opinion from the university of manitoba, quoting that ""energy is dirt cheap."" biello continues to explain that other forms of sustainable energy requires fossil fuels to gather the resources in the first place, effectively defeating the clean revolution's purpose. overall, biello clearly expressed his anger and frustration in others' effort to switch to sustainable energy and is constantly insinuating in his article that idea is futile.
biello addresses smil's speak at the recent equinox summit regarding the plan to devise a new energy scenario for 2030 and concluded that it is impractical to build power plants to harvest energy from hot rocks to solar battery combos. he appears to be unsupportive towards the sustainable option, as even the simplest components like steel and cement requires coal to be burned, and the same scenario applies to cheap plastic photovoltaics require polymers made from oil. however, despite biello's constant effort to dismiss the sustainable ideas, he failed to suggest a pragmatic solution to the problem, thus rendering his article fairly biased.
biello constantly uses expert's opinion to capture his readers' attention but fails to support his arguments with appropriate statistical data. quoting vague claims like ""we're not running out of anything on a human scale"" to argue that coal is not running out is not only misleading but also unprofessional, as it is supposedly said by professor vaclav smil.
ultimately, biello switches to intimidate the tax payers by pointing out that ""tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and a dead zone in the gulf of mexico"" went into farmig ethanol from corn. he asserts that ""we should focus our resources and attention on what has the best chance to succeed"" and later pointed out ""that's not biofuels. it is pv."" the abbreviation is poorly used in the context, however, biello soon after cleared the confusions by explaining that pv stands for photovoltaic modules. overall, biello has clearly explained why he does not support the energy system reform proposal but fails to suggest pragmatic solutions to the energy crisis.",1,F,VIETNAMESE

3. personal information: ""includes name, address, phone, mobile, fax, email"" - there is a box for no fax in the explanatory notes. do you want a fax number or not? hopefully no as it is so outdated.
4. skills - explanatory notes has a box for""key skills summary after career objective (optional)"". does this mean the skills section is optional or its positioning is optional?
career connect advised against a skills section altogether and said your skills should already be summarised under your employment entries using the 'power verb + transferable skill + qualitative outcome' formula mentioned in the employment section of the rubric.
5. skills - explanatory notes mention listing personal attributes. is this optional?
again, career connect adivse against this and suggest the information should be woven into the resume elsewhere.

"critique of why is australia trying to shut down climate activism?
damien cave and livia albeck-ripka try to investigate the reasons behind australias attempt to shut down climate activism, yet it is a country that is intimately associated with coal mining. the authors offer a background to some of the notable protest cases in the country, whereby a single activist halted raining services by tying himself to the tracks. in other cases, protesters have caused a gridlock by closing some of the busiest roads in sydney, and the government has responded with threats that it may introduce laws meant to prevent such protests. the authors also offer a justification for such an upsurge in protests, insisting that the country is far behind in its commitment to cut down greenhouse emissions, and this amounts to an abandonment of the paris agreement that was abandoned earlier by the trump administration as well. they remain fair and balanced in their writing, referring to the beginning of such climate change wars. according to the authors, most of these emission reduction wars mostly featured in election campaigns, but now they are turning into the streets and manifesting in the most notable protests that the country has ever experienced. they also refer to other countries, stating that there are nations which have experienced climate change protests before, but australia stands out because it is determined to quell any forms of activism.
while the article appears balanced, most of the information stands out as mere assertions because it is not backed up by facts and statistical data. the authors report that the forces behind climate change activism in australia have their roots in national identity, a growing rift between the public and government opinion, as well as the economics of climate change, but there is no statistical information detailing how climate change initiatives have changed and shaped the country over time. the authors also state that australia is full of coal-loving politicians, but it is not clear whether they own coal-mining companies, have shares in some of these companies, or are simply adamant in passing the kind of legislation that would outlaw or at least slow down the rate of coal mining in the country. 
beyond the absence facts, the article covers the topic extensively, and there is no missing information. for instance, the authors review the assertions used by scientists in fighting coal mining activities if at all there are any hopes of mitigating the effects of climate change. damien cave and livia albeck-ripka believe that australia is the biggest exporter of coal globally and besides, it exports large amounts of natural gas. whereas this continues to nourish the economy, the country continues getting dumb. after leaving office, some of the law makers associate themselves with the coal-mining industry, and this is why the government is keen on banning activism. a survey that was conducted by the australian institute indicated that 81% of the people in australia fear that climate change brought along by coal mining and the burning of fossil fuel will only bring more floods and drought, and the benefits accruing from such incidences may not be offset by the economic benefits of coal mining. the balance and objectivity expressed in the article makes it legitimate, albeit with the missing statistical information to support some assertions.

from putting an end to end-to-end: gradient-isolated learning of representations https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11786.pdf, they found the following:

""""""
cpc takes a bag x = {zt+k, zj1 , zj2 , ...zjn1 } for each delay k, with one positive sample zt+k which is the encoding of the input that follows k time-steps after ct, and n  1 negative samples zjn which are uniformly drawn from all available encoded input sequences.

for the self-supervised training using the infonce objective, we need to contrast the predictions of the model for its future representations against negative samples. we draw these samples uniformly at random from across the input batch that is being evaluated. thus, the negative samples can contain samples from the same image at different patch locations, as well as from different images. we found that including the positive sample (i.e. the future representation that is currently to be predicted) in the negative samples did not have a negative effect on the final performance
""""""

allowing the positive sample to be included in the negative samples meant that instead of calculating the loss of each prediction individually, all predictions in a batch can be done in one matrix multiplication. this led to a x5 speed improvement, from 46 per batch to 9s per patch, with the prediction and loss calculations taking only 0.01s per batch (32 images per batch, 16 negative samples for loss, 5 prediction steps)
after making this change it turned out that cpc had been training all along but had been doing it too slow that i had never let it run long enough.

'changes to drylands with future climate change '
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403115119.htm
on the 3rdofapril 2020, tina hilding, addressed the issue of drylands in her article, changes to drylands with future climate change. in hildings article, she takes an informative approach to say that because of future climate change and drylands around the world increasing at an accelerated rate, their average productivity will be reduced. she continues to assert that drylands(41% of earths land surface), being an important key in the global carbon cycle and supporting almost 38% of the earths population, are more vulnerable to severe climate extremes. she also adds that regardless of drylands replacing more productive ecosystems, the overall productivity of the lands may not increase due to expected changes in precipitation and temperatures. this is seen to affect the constantly growing population that is supported by drylands, composing of grasslands and shrublands, that are important for supporting grazing and non-irrigated croplands.

in addition to that, she mentions that expansion among different types of drylands will lead to large changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland productivity. she invokes that due to changes in temperature and precipitation, these regions are most threatened as they are already water-stressed. she then adds that frequent and severe droughts also threaten their biodiversity as well as their ability to take in and hold carbon, disrupting the carbon cycle in general. hilding references that developing countries will be hit harder by the degradation of the dryland ecosystems because they hugely depend on these lands as a source of livelihood. she then backs up her argument by citing examples of areas where these changes have been seen to take place in the last few decades, in the u.s. southwest, the introduction of invasive species has changed dryland regions from green to brown. precipitation changes in australia, which is composed almost entirely of drylands, have meant a dryer continent with dramatic impacts and mongolia's grasslands have deteriorated because of warmer temperatures, less rainfall, and overgrazing. she also mentions the critical role that is played in carbon cycling by drylands and how plants facilitate the circulation of carbon dioxide by absorbing it every spring as the plants grow and exuding it out in the fall as they become dormant. she also mentions that drylands cause the most impact on year-to-year changes in the carbon cycle. hilding continues to assert that understanding the role that drylands play in future carbon cycling helps researchers regulate the preservation of areas of high carbon uptake.

hilding finishes her article by contending that as a society, we are not paying much attention to dryland areas. she is however positive that when measures are put into place and a global action plan involving stringent management and sustainable utilization of drylands is urgently implemented, the fragile ecosystems and drylands will be protected from further desertification for climate change mitigation over the next couple of decades.

current week:
meeting w/ supervisor (conducted via. zoom)
no meeting scheduled for this week.

literature review
completed and submitted literature review
final product of literature review on the technologies listed in previous post was 39 pages of text, felt this was way too long for a literature review so worked on condensing the report so that it wasn't an individual assessment of different techniques, methods and implementations but rather a summary of the most relevant parts that were best applied to this project.
ended up with 10 pages, felt all the parts in there were much more relevant and rather than diving in depth into each of the different parts of the workflow it provides a summary of the optimal workflow for developing a predictive maintenance system.
plan to use the bulk of the report that was not included in the literature in the design specification as it is more fitting in there.

design specification
started looking into hardware required for implementing the system.
through first order analysis of the requirements the psoc 5lp alone will not be suitable for the project, reasons:
an external adc will be required (simulatenous sampling, enob&gt;= 16-bits, delta-sigma type, in-built digital filters).
performance of the psoc 5lp doesn't allow it to meet timing requirements for digital signal processing (not fast enough and no hardware dsp block, many of the dsp element are just implemented in software)
hence either psoc 5lp will just have to be used for data acquisition and simple filtering tasks, and then off-load data to a more powerful mcu, sbc such as a stm32h7 line, raspberry pi, nvidia jetson, etc. will have to do some more research into this.

"good afternoon,if you have personal experience of using brt, how does it compare to the system in the video?
i have never had the privilege of using a brt system, but i think they would be more punctual because they should stop far less than an ordinary bus would. also, having wi-fi is an added bonus, so that business users could do their work while traveling to and from their workplace and students could use the time to study. what implications do you think the delhi experience has for transit planning? i believe that delhis brt system shows that transit planners cant just introduce half cut transport systems and expect people to use them. they need to build transport systems that benefit the community in the following ways:  time savings to get to places  a cheaper alternative to using privately owned vehicles  a service which is reliable and comfortable.the video compares brt to light rail. can you think of situations where brt has advantages over light rail? what about situations where light rail would be preferable?

advantages of brt over light rail:
  a brt system typically costs 4 to 20 times less than an equivalent light rail system.  brt systems can carry the same number of people as light rail systems for an average cost of four to twenty less times than an lrt system.  by using existing road systems brt can be built in phases and integrated with existing road systems.  for the australian urban environment the build cost of the busways system in brisbane is estimated to be $10million per kilometer less than the costs of an equivalent lrt system .also the adelaide north east busway at less than $10 million per kilometre in infrastructure costs is significantly cheaper than any lrt options.advantages of light rail over brt  more comfortable ride.  lower noise, both inside and out.  it is politically easier to remove cars from cbd streets if buses are also removed.",1,M,ENGLISH

"meeting agenda:
project progress:

brainstorming ideas for project scope 


installing ros (dual boot / virtual machine) 


completing ros tutorials 


completing moodle literature review modules 


literature review 

project scope:

idea 1: outdoor navigation between buildings around the university. considerations: pedestrians? obstractions? terrain? mapping methods?


idea 2: joining traffic at intersections in a socially acceptable manner. considerations: does a robot give way? how will pedestrians react to an entering robot?


idea 3: navigating through high traffic areas with dynamic obstacles. considerations: non-pedestrian traffic: bikes / skateboards / groups? dynamic obstructions?

assessment requirements:

moodle journal: level of detail, frequency, starting date and submission requirements.


risk assessment: how to apply s.a.r.a.h.


literature review: does this need to be presented in a formal way?


meeting discussion:
working off-campus:

its possible to work on the project without access to the robot by focusing on simulation. create gitlab accounts to get access to previous simulation work.

project scope:

idea 1: potential focus is enabling the robot to understand and perceive the scene it is looking at (cross-reference between the real-world and map, understand information such as building signs and road signs).


idea 2: this may require a narrow pathway with lots of people. generally the pathways in a university campus are large enough to accommodate pedestrians and robot. idea may be more suited for indoor hallways.


idea 3: consider group surfing work, and previous research controlling a robot using deep reinforcement learning. other research has looked at pedestrian tracking and or clustering pedestrians as groups.

assessment:

moodle journal: create a shared document for meeting minutes and copy these meeting notes into moodle posts. it can be in simple point form. clarify with jonathan li about submission of journal posts.


risk analysis: use a past students work as an example.


literatury review: create a shared document for notes and investigate the authors findings.

next steps:

establish a clear objective and goal for the final year project by the next week meeting.

the main progress in terms of my fyp this week was the deployment of the super resolution web app using heroku. a lot of research, as well as trial and error was required to get the web app up and running (see: http://super-res.herokuapp.com/). although the current web app that has been deployed seems to perform the main task of super resolution, there is still a lot of work required to fix certain bugs and issues with the program. the main issue is the way in which images are stored when it comes to performing the super resolution forward pass on an image and the storage of previous results. the image to be processed is currently stored locally on the server, however this is an error-prone solution as it may cause storage issues or problems when multiple users are using the web app.

"whoa, those collision diagrams are tough! trying to work out which directions combined with the dca codes can be tricky!
for intersection a:
crash map attached.
1)most common crash type is 121, with 3 crashes. but as a group, the 110s (adjacent directions) have 5 crashes.
2)i would say the primary cause of these crashes are drivers failing to give way. (except for crash 9).
3)changes:
i think there would be confusion between the stop and give way controls, leaving drivers unsure of who has right of way. a low cost treatment would be to remove the give way control for georgina grove (aaron ave is listed as the minor road, so it should keep its stop control). this should remove the confusion of which road should stop/give way. care must be taken to ensure motorists are made aware that there have been changes to these controls.
another possible treatment would be to investigate whether a roundabout could be installed. roundabouts improve safety for vehicles at intersections as they control speed (thereby reducing severity of crashes) and also reduce the number of possible conflict points between vehicles.

"hey ryan! 
this was a very interesting article and also a great review to read!
i agree that biello presents a balanced and unbiased stance on the new innovations which aim to clean our co2 instilled air. this issue we face is very timely and relevant to the world we live in. unfortunately, his article does lack data and figures of the success of these inventions. 
perhaps this missing technical information changes the articles motive; from educational and informative to explanatory, and not as reliable as first set out. another report which delves into a review of artificial trees, states that these trees can collect carbon from the atmosphere 1000 times faster than real tress in one day (ghavan.r, prabhu.t, romauld s and devi p, 2017). data such as this would enhance biellos article as it demonstrates the precision of his investigation. 
biello also presents a strong view on the consequences of excess carbon released into the air. he definitely asserts his frustration with governments as they deny a global warming problem exists. there is a call to action for more to be done as he presents heavy statistics of the consequences by the governments lack of initiation. 
i stand with him and hope that engineers such as lackner (or even one of us) can help diverge the world from irreversible climate change.

"article: ""will you want to go straight back into the crowd?""
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/cities-density-coronavirus.html
in his opinion piece about city planning following the pandemic, richard williams traces the trend of city development through the past century and how it impacts the coronavirus. he leans on architectural movements, philosophy, and historical anecdotes to suggest how ""a chastened, post-coronavirus world"" might require city plans with wide open spaces.
richard williams is a professor of visual culture at the university of edinburgh who has written a book on the purpose of city appearances. williams is a professional in his field and uses others in the field of architecture to inform his claim, like le corbusier and botigas. he also includes opinions from multiple philosophers, sociologists, and journalists who have interacted with open cityscapes. the suggestion that william makes is supported strongly by the evidence he provides and his own experience in the field.
the article opens by examining the trend of city density. people began flocking to cities since the late 1800's. this urbanization is due, in part, to the industrial revolution and the thousands of new jobs that opened up in cities. over time, people have continued to pour into cities, as a place to live and work or a place to visit. urbanization has lead to multiple health and logistical problems. these problems can result from the city development itself or the effects of city development. where urbanization went, disease and squalor followed. after engels wrote ""the condition of the working class in england"" in 1845 and the spanish flu tore through densely-packed cities in the 1920's, density became viewed as a disease for modern architects.
the idea of open cities was not agreed upon by everyone. some philosophers like simone de beauvoir described the layout as ""elegant monotony"" - referring to the modern construction of brasilia in 1960. the idea also seemed unpractical until businesses realized that money could be made from large, open spaces where people could gather. in this world where physical distancing is needed for the safety and wellbeing of the people, maybe more cities should open up. a pavilion in the middle of the city allows a person to exercise or stay 1.5 meters from their friends while catching up, whereas buildings and street corners may not. on the other hand, large, public spaces also encourage crowds.
while the article provides reliable information and evidence to support williams' claim, it doesn't address the counter-argument or provide any information. williams also does not include any scientific facts to support his claim, which would have addressed this issue from a field other than architecture, philosophy, and history.",1,M,ENGLISH

"if you have personal experience of using brt, how does it compare to the system in the video?
similar to some responses above i have also used the t-way in sydney, specifically only the t80 route from liverpool to parramatta. the main difference from the video (where the brt connects all of central indiana) is that the t-way runs through the outer suburbs as a separate corridor with dedicated lanes connecting to the parramatta cbd. the other t-way route in the north western suburbs also connects to parramatta cbd. the buses used in the t-way, from my experience are no different to other buses in sydney which now also use the same ticketing system (opal card) - also different to the advanced buses and ticketing systems highlighted in the video. as i have always travelled in peak times the buses have almost always been at capacity which deters from a comfortable bus ride but similar to the video through the dedicated lanes and limited bus stops i find that the route a provides consistently quick and efficient ride.
 the video compares brt to light rail. can you think of situations where brt has advantages over light rail? what about situations where light rail would be preferable?
using sydney as an example - the t-way connects outer suburbs to a cbd whereas light rail would better serve more central suburbs and cities, where the sydney metro and light rail are currently under construction and planning for expansion. the light rail travels through mains corridors of more centralised suburbs which have been flagged for significant rise in density and are in close proximity to train stations and main hubs. thesewill ultimately connect and coincide with the t-way both in the south west and north west of sydney, in particular the parramatta light rail under construction and also the recently norwest rail link.",1,F,TAGALOG

"i have no doubt that it is technically possible to fully automate construction processes, the question is will the motivators ever be high enough to make it happen ?
in offshore oil and gas developments, highly automated processes are used for drilling wells, installing equipment and laying pipelines on the seabed and operating the maintaining this underwater equipment. in that environment, the access limitations for humans to the workfront deep underground and underwater have driven development of specialised equipment and methodologies to accomplish the required tasks. the motivators of a hostile and inaccessible environment, safety risk to humans and the opportunity of significant commercial prize have driven technology development in order to accomplish what would have been considered inconceivable even 50 years ago. automated processes in this industry include underwater robotic vehicles to support construction tasks, inspection and maintenance and dynamically positioned construction vessels that include automated pipe laying systems to lay pipeline on the seabed, and dynamically positioned floating drilling rigs with automated drilling systems that reduce the required manual tasks.
however, in land based infrastructure construction, there is often the driver to create jobs for people as we are currently observing in victoria with the recently announced state government $2.7 billion planned new construction spend to stimulate the economy and create thousands of jobs in response to the economic impact of coronavirus. this is on top of around $35 billion existing budget for major infrastructure projects already underway by this government.  so although there are many benefits to humans associated with automation of construction, particularly with respect to safety and also productivity potentially; there is also a need for employment.  construction offers opportunity for employment across wide a range of competency and skill levels and for a diversity of businesses and it therefore is currently playing an extremely important role in employment across the state. i think this aspect of the construction will provide a level of inertia that will continue to slow the transition to more comprehensive automation in construction.

shift sub-band close to baseband for better adaptation/comparison - i think central optical tone should be removed before this step? yes, remove cot tone before here - first phase comp might not be necessary
why freqoffsetcomp twice? - probably knock out first one
matched rrc filter vs ""matched"" dynamic equalisation? - rrc filter is to match to tx, ideal, no resampling, no channel; after impairments, adds extra to rrc to account for impairments

mbc observations:
harder to get q^2 up to osnr in multiband code than single band code yet ber can still be 0 - correct: this is do to with the equaliser settings and nyquist shaping introducing numerical errors. cot removal will impact/improve q^2

cot removal filters:
not aiming to remove and discard, want to extract to analyse while doing a spectral peak search on remaining signal. aiming to find proportion of phase noise, then will recombine (convolve?) with remaining multiband

next:
put lorentzian lineshape filter onto the back burner for now
investigate linewidth: 1khz to 10mhz in single band to observe effects/breakdown, then compare with multiband in 16qam

"tropical cyclones have become more destructive over the past 40 years, data shows
by graham readfearn
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/20/tropical-cyclones-have-become-more-destructive-over-past-40-years-data-shows
in this article, graham readfearn writes how studies done by scientists at united states governments national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa), have shown that cyclone or hurricane intensity and frequency has increased over the past four decades. cyclones are bringing with them more destructive winds and according to the study, scientific models and predictions that were made several years ago are beginning to be proven correct by research conducted over the past four decades. readfearn states that satellite records obtained between 1979 to 2017 display a clear rise in very destructive cyclones, delivering winds of up to a 185 kilometers per hour. these studies have also shown that there have been rising trends in dangerous storms over australia as well. readfearn also states that this is likely correlated with rising sea temperatures. in the article, readfearn quotes dr. hamish ramsay, a senior research scientist at csiro, this study confirms what the climate models have been predicting for some time  that the proportion of the most intense storms will increase as climate warms. readfearn explains that due to natural variations in climate, proving that global warming would impact the strength of cyclones is difficult. this is understandable as key features that scientists look for, are often hidden by natural changes and are difficult to single out and analyze.
readfearn goes on to explain that the study conducted by scientists at noaa not only focused on global cyclone frequency, but also cyclone intensity. he states that dr. ramsay said that cyclone intensity and rainfall delivered is likely to increase due to warming oceans. readfearn provides some evidence and background to this by quoting dr. greg holland, a senior scientist emeritus at thenational center for atmospheric researchin colorado. an article by brian donegan presenting the same study focused on in readfearns article, contains a quote from james kossin, a noaa scientist which provides further support. kossin says ""our results show that these storms have become stronger on global and regional levels, which is consistent with expectations of how hurricanes respond to a warming world,"" (donegan, 2020). in addition to this, readfearn also writes that australia, being in cyclone prone area, is likely to experience this increase in intensity in the future.
this article is mostly based on facts and scientific explanation. readfearn is merely presenting the readers with information on the topic. therefore, the article is quite balanced. in this article, readfearn extensively quotes what sources have said on the topic, and a majority of the scientific and research evidence for the discussion is from them. readfearn has taken time to interview his sources and his sources are all of academic level and are therefore credible and help validate his article. however, although readfearn refers to a one or more studies done by scientists, in his article, he doesnt provide a reference to this study for anyone interested in them.
overall, the article is quite informative, and provides the readers with sound information and sufficient evidence and explanation to back it up.

"critique of carbon capture technology article
this written piece provides a critique of the following article: jeff johnson, capturing carbon: can it save us? (25 february 2019) chemical and engineering news vol 97(8) &lt;https://cen.acs.org/environment/greenhouse-gases/capturing-carbon-save-us/97/i8&gt;

summary of the articles key points
jeff johnsons article examines the role that emerging negative emission technologies (nets) can play in the fight against climate change, and discusses whether these technologies can be scaled up fast enough to make a difference on a global scale. nets are methods that physically and chemically remove co2 and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. johnson argues that nets will not be a silver bullet solution to climate change. however, he contends their use can ease the path to the world achieving net zero emissions by 2050  the target set by the united nations under the paris agreement to limit the average global temperature rise to 2 degrees celsius. to substantiate this, johnson examines five different types of net and analyses how feasible it may be for each one to be scaled up fast enough to meet the paris agreement target. the five nets he examines are, namely, atmospheric co2 extraction, biomass fuels, underground gas burial, mineralisation, and plant regrowth methods.

analysis and supporting evidence 
in his article, johnson does a decent job of objectively assessing the pros and cons of each of the 5 net methods under examination. he does this by outlining the primary benefits, constraints, current cost, co2 removal capacity, and further research requirements associated with each technology. by assessing each net in terms of these objective criteria, the author allows the merits of each method to be compared with one another, and thus provides an impartial evaluation of the overall feasibility and effectiveness of each net. moreover, as the author does not provide a final conclusion, he leaves it up to the reader to form their own opinion of which method is best which further adds to the objectivity of his analysis.
johnson relies on a research study by the us national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine to substantiate many of his conclusions. given this study is very comprehensive (510 pages long) and comes from a highly credible source, johnsons arguments subsequently appear to be well founded and reliable.
with regard to his discussion of the underground gas burial method, johnson mentions the potential for gas leaks to cause legal and financial liability issues over time as quantities [of co2] grow to billions of metric tons and storage stretches to hundreds of thousands of years. however, he possibly overstates the true danger associated with these risks given there is evidence to support that even in an unlikely, badly-regulated, worst-case scenario, at least 78% of injected co2 is likely to stay retained underground when using this net method [1].
finally, johnsons analysis remains balanced as he reminds readers that expecting nets to save the world on their own is not realistic given they will likely always be a more expensive option than approaches that limit emissions in the first place. nonetheless, by framing his discussion around nets being engineering solutions which can help to address the global issue of climate change, the auhtor still manages to convey a subtly optimistic tone throughout his article. however, he perhaps falls short in emphasising the urgency nations must take to accelerate innovations with nets so that these technologies can have a substantial impact in combating climate change [2].

conclusion 
overall, by using credible evidence to analyse the merits and disadvantages of each net method without concluding which method is best in his own personal opinion, johnson provides a highly objective assessment of how nets can be used to tackle climate change. this balanced and evidence-based approach, coupled with a neutral tone, thus provides a realistic and reliable assessment of the issues and potential solutions canvassed throughout the article.

"hi all, there are different nn-based models, which are multilayer feedforward neural networks (mlfnn), time-delay neural networks (tdnn), recurrent neural networks (rnn), convolution neural networks (cnn), deep belief networks (dbn), radial basis function neural networks (rbfnn), wavelet neural networks (wnn) and fuzzy neural networks (fnn). each one of those are depending on different traffic parameters and the number of hidden layers. however, the integration between to models such as hybrid methods that use a combination of different approaches to build a more effective model. two-hybrid deep architectures inheriting the advantages of cnns and lstm nns were developed to capture both spatial and temporal traffic correlations. the models can utilize the capabilities of different methods simultaneously, so the ability of modelling-sophisticated correlations in traffic networks can be enhanced. there are different types of data has been collected using simulation and real data, the real data collected via different methods such as loop detectors, probe vehicles or global positioning system (gps) equipment, and remote traffic microwave sensors (rtms). among the sources of real-time data, loop detector data are the most widely used. loop detectors to predict different traffic variables, mainly for traffic volumes, however, loop detector data coverage is limited by the cost of placing the sensors.rtms, which is a radar-based detection system, is another reliable source of traffic data that can detect volume, speed, and occupancy. compared to loop detectors, these sensors are more cost-effective.gps-equipped devices have become popular, gps data are now being used more to predict average speeds, this type of data provides as much coverage as the number of probe vehicles allows. while this is a potentially extensive source, the availability of gps data can be limited because it depends on the vehicles' journeys. overall, data play an important role in training and testing nns, the characteristics of different data sources are worth considering when building models. however, the integration between deep learning and big data can be beneficial to have access to different real-time traffic data with an inconsiderable cost.",1,M,ARABIC

"
all-day: 
all-day parking is helpful around offices to allow for commuters to drive to work if they do not live near public transport hubs.
some all-day parking is helpful around shops for business owners
all-day parking around the train station is also necessary for commuters to park their cars.
resident only:
residential zones close to the town centre (train stations, offices, shops etc.) require residential parking only to stop people from using their on-street housing parking.
2-hour parking:
the two-hour parking should be utilised close to shops and commercial zones to allow for short shopping trips to be conducted. this will encourage high turnover, especially on high street.
it is also beneficial to use two-hour parks near offices to allow for short meetings to occur.
loading zones:
deliveries to each of the four main commercial/shopping precincts are necessary to provide access to shops.
a loading zone to the offices may be necessary for major deliveries.
bike: 
there needs to be adequate bicycle parking at the train station to allow for park and ride commuters to utilise their bikes instead of driving and parking at the station.
having bicycle parking near shops and commercial areas is also necessary to encourage bicycle trips rather than private vehicle use.
underground or internal bicycle parking facilities should be mandatory in offices.
accessible: 
there should be accessible parking near the train station.
a minimum of two separate accessible zones should be made available in the shops/commercial zones. these should be on the same side of the road as the shops to avoid unnecessary crossings of the road.
fees:
all day parking (excluding at the train station and offices) will incur a fee of $6-$8.
prime location parking in the shopping precinct will incur smaller fees, $3-$4.
other notes:
through traffic has been minimised on high street by having large amounts of short-term parking to encourage turnover and thus lower speeds.
no parking has been allocated on through street to allow for a bypass of the town.
a large multistorey parking facility at the train station will help to take the stress off residents and their parking rights.

"hi, this is ruihua from group14, i want to talk about the excitonic, it is like i said in the class, it's in the chemical physics field which is studying about the particulates. to talk about the excitonic, i'd like to explain what the exciton is.
anexcitonis a boundof an electron and an electron holewhich are attracted to each other by the electrostatic coulomb force. it is an electrically neutral quasiparticlethat exists in insulators,semiconductorsand some liquids. the exciton is regarded as an elementary excitation of condensed matterthat can transport energy without transporting net electric charge.
an exciton can form when a material absorbs a photonof higher energy than its bandgap.this excites an electron from the valence bandinto the conduction band. in turn, this leaves behind a positively charged electron hole(an abstraction for the location from which an electron was moved). the electron in the conduction band is then effectively attracted to this localized hole by the repulsivecoulomb forcefrom large numbers of electrons surrounding the hole and excited electron. this attraction provides a stabilizing energy balance
as we presented, aphotochemical reaction is a chemical reaction that is initialized by the absorption of light and involves an electronically excited state in at least one reactionstep. in the simplest case, the reactant a is promoted to one of its electronicallyexcited states a* by absorption of a photon. the chemical properties of a* can bequite different from those of the electronic ground state a, i.e. a* can be regardedas a different chemical species.
the energy diagram in figure illustrates the advantages of a photochemical reaction, we can understand what is the excitonic state.
in conclusion, macroscopically speaking, excitonic is a state ofelementary excitation of condensed matter, which can help prompt chemical reaction process because it can transport energy.",1,M,MANDARIN

"hi greg, not a problem, its starting to become clearer: 
so for fixed costs
- as the production rate increases (scale increases), the total fixed costs stay the same, but because production rate increases, the fraction of the fixed costs used to produce each unit decreases. 
- the fixed cost / unit decreases because the constant fixed costs are spread over more units. 
for variable costs,
- they are the same for each unit produced regardless of scale. as production scale increases doubles, the variable costs double because you need twice as much raw materials or energy to produce twice as many units. 
the variable costs required per unit is always the same 
how does this change when you invest money in plant operating technology to improve production rate? because it should decrease the energy/material requirement is it a variable cost? or because it is a capital expenditure should it be a fixed cost?

"yes, carbon emissions fell duringcovid-19. but its the shift away from coal that reallymatters
frank jotzo and mousami prasad recently produced an article analysing the impact that the covid-19 quarantine had on carbon emissions in australia and around the world. notably, they indicate that the drop in emissions in australia is due to a shift to renewable energy sources, instead of what most people are assuming is due to the covid-19 situation.
jotzo and prasad showcase that whilst the lockdown is partially responsibility for the lowered carbon emissions in australia in 2020 thus far, the greatest contribution to this decrease is the investment in clean energy sources such as solar and wind power. referring to comparisons in emissions and electricity generation to this time 12 months ago, they produce a very fact-driven and balanced analysis of the situation. the impact of the resultant lowered electricity costs on non-renewable resources such as coal power plants is also detailed, inferring that this will make them far less profitable, further promoting the possibility of renewable energy being further utilised.
this article was published on the conversation, a website which features a disclosure statement on the authors that reveals whether the authors could be impacted by a conflict of interest, of which it is noted that there is none for jotzo or mousami, indicating this could reasonable be relied on as an impartial article. the article as a whole is very balanced and does not present a large level of bias, rather an impartial investigation that is highly reliant on statistics and data. in addition, they give detailed explanations of what the data indicates, and give credit to the covid-19 lockdown for some of the reduction in emissions, which means that no key information is left out, and the reader is completely informed.
this article is highly reliant on statistics and research, presenting an analysis of this data and what it means for the future of australias emissions, and electricity generation and usage. they reveal that whilst electricity demand fell by 3% (compared to this time in 2019) during the first seven weeks of lockdown, emissions fell by 8.5%. in addition, of that 3% reduction in electricity demand, 1% was due to extra rooftop solar panels  which lowered demand on the grid. the reason for the large difference between the change in emissions, and the change in demand, is explained by the increase in the utilisation of renewable energy sources. they cite a 55% increase in solar output and a 19% increase in wind parks output resulting from new installed capacity coming online, which is verified by the australian governments renewable energy target website.
overall, the article is well balanced and researched, providing suggestions based on the data, as opposed to making the data fit their opinion.

"this week involved more prototyping to create core functionality for the website. this week saw:
- implementation of draggable svg functionality for the frequency domain for the signals- addsignal() is working as intended now (no svg overlaying issues, adds svgs and dials in the control tab as intended)- the controls and dials to control the amplitude and frequency of signals in time domain are working as intended (the slider and entering integers in a text box)
there currently are a few bugs that still need to be ironed out, such as:
- removesignal() removes the dials in the control tab but doesnt remove the time representation of the signal- certain frequencies of signals dont seem to be interpolating properly (maybe there are too few points to be interpolated or the current interpolation method, curvebasis, is not the proper method)- adjusting the coefficients from the dials changes the signal in time and frequency domain, but adjusting from the frequency domain (dragging circles) doesnt update the dials nor signal in time domain.
priorities for the following weeks:
1) updating elements from drag functions this is the most unknown task at the moment (in terms of budgeting for time of effort). however, this is a fundamental functionality that can extend to other applications (e.g. phasor vectors, sum of signals frequency representations etc.). so, its a fairly high priority to show working functionality.
2) sum of signals representationthis should be a relatively simple task to do as we currently store all the signals values in arrays
3) animate the signalsthis should be also hopefully be a straightforward task, as its merely a cyclical permutation, or repeatedly pushing the last element in the signal values array to the first element. however its not as a core functionality as the above at the moment.

"introduction
this review criticises the following article:
wright, i &amp; reynolds j 2019, when water is scarce, we cant afford to neglect the alternatives to desalination, the conversation, viewed 29 march 2020, https://theconversation.com/when-water-is-scarce-we-cant-afford-to-neglect-the-alternatives-to-desalination-111249
overall contention
in their article, wright and reynolds contend that greater emphasis and reliance should be placed on alternatives to desalination plants to supply drinking water, including water recycling and demand management. they argue that the growth in desalination has drowned out the interest in alternative solutions, which could assist in providing water for an ever-booming australian population.
evidence
throughout the article, the authors cite case studies to provide evidence for the success of recycled water in australia. for instance, they reference sydneys rouse hills recycled water scheme, which is currently providing recycled water for suburban use, and agricultural examples in south australia, victoria and new south wales. by validating their arguments with a vast array of case studies, they are able to effectively demonstrate the wealth of evidence supporting their contention.
they also offer statistics in the form of figures to show how water restrictions have effectively managed demand. they linked melbournes success with the target 155 program, however they left the reader guessing as to why other capital cities have had less success. the discussion concerning the price of residential water across the country also fails to draw a link back to their overarching contention. the chart and associated charges per kl do not convey an understandable argument and instead bombard the reader with numbers. therefore, the research is at times used to effectively reinforce their position, but at other times, remains confusing.
development of argument
at the conclusion of the article, the authors used a measured tone to submit their recommendations for how australia should proceed with managing falling water supply levels. they did not condemn desalination, but instead advanced the argument that policy-makers should prioritise recycling and water conservation. as a result, they avoided alienating pro-desalination stakeholders which was an effective way to develop their argument. by also providing links throughout the document to external sources, this allowed the reader to find out more information if they so wished.
however, the authors missed an opportunity to draw comparisons between these alternatives and desalination. the article does not delve into why we should be opting for recycling and water conservation instead of desalination, or why they should be more highly prioritised. this is important for governments in allocating funding in their annual budgets to know what should be prioritised more.
for example, a 2006 journal article discussed the public perception of desalination contrasted with recycled water. their research indicated that australians currently have fewer reservations about desalinated water than recycled water (dolnicar &amp; schafer 2006, p. 8). dolnicar and schafer also compared energy consumption, water quality and environmental issues between the two approaches. this showed a far more comprehensive analysis of the issue, which wright and reynolds fail to do. for example, wright and reynolds failed to point out that desalination costs 2.21 times higher than recycling (dolnicar &amp; schafer 2006, p. 2) and that recycling has greater quality assurance issues when using the water for potable purposes (dolnicar &amp; schafer 2006, p. 3). without drawing these types of comparisons, wright and reynolds article falls short in its analysis of water supply solutions.
wright and reynolds have also not discussed the drawbacks to recycled water that some stakeholders may be concerned about. these include potential health risks if the water is mismanaged, the cost, time and complexity of building, operating and maintaining recycling plants, and whether there will be any environmental impacts when using recycled water in irrigation (sydney water 2013; recycled water in australia 2019).
conclusion
ultimately, wright and reynolds provide a research-based article on the success stories of water conservation and recycling. however, their failure to shed light on the disadvantages of these approaches or make comparisons to desalination, mean that their article is incomplete and less persuasive to the reader.",1,M,ENGLISH

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/rapid-shift-to-renewable-energy-could-lead-australia-to-cheap-power-and-100000-jobs
in response to morrisons governments gas-fired recovery plan, adam mortons article published on the 29th of may 2020 in the guardian outlines how a rapid shift to renewable energy can provide cheap power and 10000 jobs. mortons background as an environment editor for the guardian makes his piece more reputable as he is assumed to have background knowledge on the topic, and he has experience writing on topics similar in the past. he confidently and consistently states that a push to growing renewables is a greater strategy to reinvigorating australias economy in response to the damage done by the covid 19 pandemic. his informative approach is used to contend that a renewable energy development is a better approach to overcoming the economic shock than to ignite the gas industry to drive economic recovery. his consistent referencing to environmental thinktanks report and technical content shows that his opinion is more credible and based in factual evidence.
morton highlights how a shift toward a renewable future can cut electricity cost and create 100000 jobs. he identifies that the morrison government is backing away from renewables and towards fossil fuels, following this he states that renewable energy investment in australia fell 50% last year. he does this to emphasise how the current government is going against renewables which he portrays as the solution thus making his argument more valid by presenting the other side as the problem. thus, positioning his audience to back renewable energy for the future. within his article he discusses how renewable energy will become more affordable and that supporting renewable will bring investments into australia to fund renewables and create jobs in the sector. to support his contention, he utilises a report done by a thinktank called beyond zero emissions which was done as the first stage of a million jobs plan. this report outlines how australia can have a zero-emission future and create economic growth. saying that the renewable approach will create 22000 ongoing jobs and 124000 construction jobs. this information, however, is from one study by one think tank, the other information he uses to accompany this is quotes by the chief executive and also does not provide a second opinion. a second source of data would make his arguments even more credible and reliable. he then goes on to explain how australia is the outlier in a global stance to target net zero emissions, by stating that the government continues to reject the call to net zero emissions internationally. this highlights how the opposing argument to back fossil fuels is a minority and therefore a minimally supported decision, by doing this morton situates his audience to see how a push to renewables is the right thing to aim for, to create jobs and boost the economy, persuading the audience to feel resentment to the current government for taking the ill advised approach.
in its entirety this article is based in factual ideas and professional opinion on a subject that has been heavily discussed and has a majority support. his informative and candid tone does not attack the opposition but highlights information that clarifies how the opposing ideas are injudicious and misguided. he smoothly outlines how renewables are a solution to the current world crisis and the correct approach for australia to take in the future.

i think ours are quite similar and we both also had the additional drop-off zone at the train station.
one difference is the residential streets near the train station, where you had both sides as resident only, and i tried to limit that to resident only on one side.  this obviously varies depending on the location and demand, but many places that i can think of try to do the balance of protecting some parking for locals, while allowing some parking for visitors. it also recognises a couple of other things:
-residential areas should have some amount of parking within their property, and not just rely on on-street parking (this generally applies to most areas, unless they're very old and developed in a pre-car era, at least for australia).
-residential areas that close to public transport should be able to have reduced residential parking requirements
of course, as this was a simple parking activity, we weren't given the wide range of tools that could be used, or a full assessment of the area's parking conditions. and then you could probably write a thesis on the proposal!

"chitosan is a partially deacetylated polymer obtained by the alkaline deacetylation of chitin, a biopolymer extracted from shellfish sources. it is a linear hydrophilic amino polysaccharide with a rigid structure containing both glucosamine and acetylglucosamine (poly--(14)-2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucose) units. chitin (poly--(14)-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine) can be characterised as one of the most abundant natural biopolymers. flocculation is an essential phenomenon in industrial wastewater treatment. organic polymeric flocculants are widely used nowadays due to its remarkable ability to flocculate efficiently with low dosage compared with inorganic coagulants (salts of multivalent metals) that are being commonly used (due to its low cost and ease of use) but have low flocculating efficiency and present the residual concentration of metal in the treated water. in this context, the coagulation and flocculation properties of chitosan (given by their cationic charge) can be exploited to remove the negative-charged colloidal organic or inorganic impurities from wastewaters. the protonated amine groups along the chain obtained by dissolving of chitosan in acids facilitate electrostatic interactions between polymer chains and the negatively charged contaminants (metal anions, dyes, organic compounds, etc.). due to the presence of primary amino groups, the biopolymer has a high cationic charge density and long chains with high molecular weight, being an effective coagulant and/or flocculant for the removal of contaminants in the suspended and dissolved state.
the active amino groups (nh2) in the chitosan molecule can be protonated with h+ in water into a cationic polyelectrolyte such that the molecule has characteristics of static attraction and adsorption. chitosan coagulation produces better quality floaters, namely, larger floaters with faster settling velocity. the effectiveness of chitosan for coagulating mineral suspensions can be improved due to the presence of inorganic solutes or due to the addition of materials extracted from soils at high ph. based on their proved properties, chitosan can be a very promising adsorption additive for wastewater pollutants. aiming to improve their adsorption performances, chitosan can be modified by grafting, cross linking, functionalisation for forming composites, etc. based on its origin product (chitin which can be found abundant in marine media, i.e. in the exoskeleton of crustaceans or cartilages of molluscs), the potential of chitosan to be used as (bio) adsorbent for wastewater pollutants is strong. however, the main drawback that limits the use of chitosan at industrial level is their low solubility in aqueous media. in this respect, the performances of chitosan can be improved by cross linking with different reagents, allowing chitosan composites to be used in acidic condition. to form composites with chitosan, different kinds of substances have been used. the cationic nature of chitosan influences the adsorption mechanism of chitosan composites. in acid ph conditions, the amino groups of chitosan form protonated amines able to retain the metal ions or dye molecules from solutions or wastewaters. the interaction mechanisms can be through electrostatic attractions or/and complexation.
although there is a wide range of chitosan derivatives with adsorption properties (raw chitosan, chitosan derivatives, chitosan composites, etc.), choosing the most suitable type of adsorbent in pollutant adsorption processes is still developed.

"hi
from first impressions of your website redesign, i really like the bold and bubbly-ness to it as it's easy on the eyes and looks appealing to a customer. 
i like your ""news and announcements"" sections and the fact that you put it at the top which is the first thing customers will see once entering the website which of course shows the latest deals. 
your popular categories section is a nice touch as it allows customers to easily navigate to what they enjoy and their interests. 
i do also enjoy the colourful gradient of purple and pink as well! 

some suggestions i have would be to maybe add a bit more as there isn't too much going on.

stasi archive is open for access to individuals, since 1992, and i went through the stasi archives website it clearly has no option for people to access an individual's file, only a blood relative or the person themselves get to access. the movie as such showcases how power and records are interconnected and how they influence each other. the notion that few characters in the movie thought that they were being watched, had a huge impact on their behaviour. this movie also concludes with a perfect example of what happens when a record is not captured in a fair/right way, it ends up serving no purpose.

 the best case time complexity for insertion sort is o(n) and the worst case of it is o(n^2). because when the array to be sorted is in order, it is the optimal case. it only needs to compare the current number with the previous number. in this case, a total of n- 1 comparisons are needed. however, the worst case is that the array to be sorted is in reverse order. in this case, the maximum number of comparisons is required. the total number of comparisons is denoted as: 1+2+3+... + n - 1.
 for selection sort, the case is n=(n-1+(n-2+...+1=n*(n-1/2. if the list is already sorted, the switching times is zero, but the number of comparisons will not change.so both best and worst case for selection sort are o(n^2).",1,M,MANDARIN

some changes i would make is the small ""things to do"" section as it seems to overlap between different section boundaries and the purpose of putting it out of place is unclear. 
another thing might be to fill in the final section more as about half of the section is empty space.

i enjoyed your website redesign. overall, the website looks livelier and cleaner than before, with more use of colour and visual elements than before.  the most effective information architecture change was the inclusion of a menu and reservations navigation tab. in the original website, there was a get a quote and call button on the top-bar, but in the shoes of a potential customer, one might think to check the menu first after coming on the website or think of making a reservation at the physical restaurant. thus, that was a tasteful modification made to your redesign. a nice visual change made was the use of an overlaid image as your background. users can vaguely see the image of the product in the background, while not getting distracted from the text and images above it. the overlay is a good way to allow your text to stand out as well.  if i could change one aspect of your design, it would be to spread out the text a little more. the line spacing of the text is too close and this makes it hard to read it. overall, great job!",1,F,MANDARIN

i have been working on the assignment and have encountered a problem. i am unable to copy the code provided by msfvenom into the buffer. this is because there are some null characters in the file causing the strcpy to stop. if i was to break the strcpy into multiple statements to get all the data into the badfile, stack.c will stop copying the contents of badfile after it has seen the first null character. i have been told to just copy the code until the first null character and it should work but it doesnt.
i tried replacing the shellcode with the one used in 3.2 task 1 and i was able to invoke a shell. this tells me that the way my badfile is structured should be correct and that the problem lies with the reading / writing of the msfvenom shellcode into the badfile

"in different industries, it is crucial to fully understand users needs and requirements, and librarians are no exception, for librarians, the reference interview is a good way for them to understand users needs. a reference interview is a conversation between librarians and users, users ask questions about their needs, then librarians will clarify users real needs based on their description, helping users find their desired information resources at the last.
as far as i am concerned, the reference interview is depended on information literacy. with the development of technology, people start to focus on the information literacy, causing plenty of literature, and there are many examples of implementations of research into practice (addison, c, et al, 2013). oliver, g. (2017) also said that information literacy is a skill for the acquisition of information, help people cultivate habits of mind and also be a social practice. it is evident to find that information literacy is the compulsory skill for librarians, and librarians can combine the information literacy and reference interview together, improving the interviews effectiveness and efficient.
nowadays, people prefer to do the most thing on the internet, including searching information resources, so, libraries start to provide online or virtual reference services for users. it provides a more convenient way for users to communicate with librarians, talking about their expectation. users can experience the interaction with librarians at home, getting what they want after communicating online with librarians. besides, after communicating, a record of the chat is left, which the user can review at any time to ensure that they do not leave any important information behind, such as the desired resources links. users also have at their fingertips access to more library resources than all previous generating of library users put together (curry, e. l. 2005). moreover, communicating online can avoid some problems, such as language barriers, librarians can catch users initial expectation easier within their specialized subject areas, and they dont need to juggle service between patrons (curry, e. l. 2005). in my opinion, in the digital environment (websites), reference work is more important than ever.
however, it still reveals some drawbacks. firstly, it will be consuming more time and cost for interviewing, transcribing, analyzing and giving feedback to users. then in the digital environment, users often only talk with one librarian, the librarian may misunderstand users needs, and different librarians may understand and transcribe reference interviews in different ways, guiding users to the wrong direction. so, we need to improve the online reference interview in the future, trying to understand users need more clearly and more quickly.

"the movie woman in gold is about a painting of a womans aunt which was stolen by the nazis during world war 2. it is a factual story of maria altmans journey of finding justice and reclaiming her art back and rightly so. it also is story of not giving up, how unpredictable our legal system is regardless of what country it is. most importantly this movie shows how records (of any kind) can be abused and at the same time be an instrument of justice as we saw in the movie.
before we dive deep and discuss eric ketelaar work and relate it to the movie, we need to talk about the different records we found in the movie.
records 
most important and well the subject of this movie the painting which was in fact a picture of her aunt. her blood relation to the aunt should have been enough to prove that it indeed belonged to her.
a letter by marias sister
the holocaust monument
the letter or will by the aunt's husband
letter by the aunt her self-leaving the paintings to the gallery
art restitution laws
the catalog of paintings in the us
all their stolen belongings (books, cello, jewels)
archived documents
the house in austria
all these records were either made, created by transactions that hide atrocities done by the nazis, some records were made before for pure joy and some are completely neutral that existed and will continue to exist and some unintentionally.
looking at eric ketelaar's works he mentions records, then, maybe instruments of power, but paradoxically, the same records can also become instruments of empowerment, freedom.. this was exactly the case in the movie. the archives in the museum, a letter was found that made adeles husband the true owner thus making adeles will obsolete only a mere piece of paper with her wishes not legally binding. this was a very strong piece of evidence that would have prevailed at any court and overturned decisions however in the movie you can see how the gallery just shuts them down by saying and i quote  right now, we have all the information we need it gave maria hope, to keep fighting for what was hers.
another part in the movie that shows how records even ones created unintentionally or for a completely different purpose can help gain freedom or liberation from a tyrant. the painting catalog found on us soil a completely innocuous book, showcasing the art gave them the power to fight the case on us soil where one does need 1.8 million $ just to get yourself heard in front of a judge.
eric ketelaar's really nice example in his work is in fact again of the nazis and their brilliant record-keeping even though it was of stolen stuff has made it possible now for stuff like art, jewelrys to be returned to their rightful owners. this again is an example of the holocaust.
in the movie records for abuse as well adeles will even though not a binding document was used against her own kin. the gallery deliberately took it word to word and not the context. adeles if she had foreseen the nazis and how her future generation would live, would never have given it to the gallery. eric ketelaar really aptly mentions about the power records hold  ..records do not speak for themselves because they merely echo what the creator had meant and what the user of the documents wants it to tell him or her..  exactly what happened in the movie, austria wanted the record adeles letter to be the last standing document even though it doesnt make any sense leaving your family penniless and give all your treasures to someone else. in the movie there is a line had she known what came next she would never have done this we are of course talking about adele here. no sane person would.
this movie and eric ketelaar show how societies, governments, organizations, and people use and abuse records either to gain some advantage or to find justice.

"how do jpeg images change as the quality is reduced?
jpegs become more and more pixelated as the quality is reduced. it looks like it is using a sub-sampling method, to find average colours between a group of pixels, causing a reduced image to look 'blocky'
how do gif images change as the quality is reduced?
as gif images reduce they lose a lot of clarity and sharpness between colours. the image looks as if it has undergone quantisation optimisation, which creates 'wavy' looking strips of the same colour. this is most evident in higher detail images such as balloons.
which file format and quality setting is the best for balloons.png?
because balloons is a highly detailed image with lots of different pixels, it doesn't compress very well. the best compressed option is 75% jpeg, because it keeps the colours more accurate than gif

"hi xu i totally agree with your point about the content management and data redundancy issues of pandora. besides, the user interface of pandora is less user-friendly compared with other national archives (e.g. uk web archive). which should be designed easier for users to manipulate and retrieve information. a significant upgrade to web content management and user-interface is needed. in addition, regards to archive management policy, it is recommended to use the trustworthy repositories audit &amp; certification: criteria and checklist (trac) to evaluate and assess the repository for better digital archival performance.

"the pandora archive collects certain australian web resources that cover social, political, cultural, religious, scientific or economic aspects, and it is built by the national library of australia(nla) in 1996 to perserve australias documentary heritage in a format that represents the collection or work at its best based on a set of policies, procedures and a technical infrastructure.
the copyright infringement is a big issue for the nla and the pandora archive (glanville, 2010). it costs a lot of time to repeatedly seek permission to archive materials of interest, which could be a problem that should be considered due to the fact that the large amounts of material that are relevant and ideally should be archived but are not, because of time constraints and copyright issues. this problem has been solved since the provision for legal deposit of digital format publications was added to theaustralian copyright act 1968in 2016. now the nla may copy australian websites without acquiring permission. they now dont have to seek for permission from publishers before copying a website to the pandora archive, and may request publisher assistance if required. in this way, it improves the efficency of the selection process. also, selective archiving can be more efficient if pandora archive further cooperates with publishers.
the pandora archive mainly adopts the the selective archiving, and the current selective archiving policyof nla selection guidelines has enabled the library to build an archive of 3,400 titles, both static and dynamic, which has covered many areas. however, the extent of a selective archive is very limited compared to the large number of materials in a whole countrys domain. although it seems reasonable to say that lots of articles, reports or videos are not worth being studied, it is the fact that we will miss some information that might be valuable to history when we discard these materials. it is relatively easy to evaluate if the material is valuable at present based on given constraints, while it is hard to make a judgement whether the material has value in futures study.

"hi khurram, 
i have tried this method above for both the example you gave and the assignment. i find, after simplifying, that with the example above i get the equations:
36x = 4 (mod 8) and 2y^3 = 6 (mod 8). and then we can add them together to get:
36x + 2y^3 = 10 (mod 8). 
however i'm finding with the assignment that i can't get a combination of the simplified numbers that will give me ""6"" for the 20x + 3y^3 = 6(mod 9). am i doing something wrong or i this an indication that the modulo isn't possible?

"how could monash library improve access to its physical and digital collections?
the digital and physical collection of the monash library has formed a very large database for students and teachers to collect resources, but there are still many potential problems that need to be improved.
from the point of view of physical collections, it is important to manage the borrowing and return of books, but the method of returning books in monash now is impossible to maximize the efficiency of books.
the time difference between returning to the first floor and being unified managed by the librarian may affect the use of others. it is recommended that returned books should be put on shelves in time by themselves and register on the machine to facilitate readers to borrow.
the collection of book resources is always in circulation, and the faster the book is circulated, the greater the role it plays (stelmaszewska, 2004). thelibrarian should strengthen the sorting of the bookshelf, find the wrong books in time, ensure the accuracy of the classification and improve the book circulation rate.
from the digital point of view, problems with browsing and retrieving content.
at present, the monash library can only retrieve and discover content in one way. the vocabulary difference when searching for entries may cause a great difference in search content which influence to improve search relevance (hazen, 2011). for example, users search terms may be different from book terms. how to connect the two to make users search for the content they want to the maximum.
in the monash library, integrating access to digital and physical materials remains a challenge.users looking for items in the library catalogue should be able to identify the item, regardless of its original physical or digital form. it should be presented in a fully integrated manner (hazen, 2011). however, it is not just the monash library. for most libraries, many digital jobs are disconnected from traditional library services. even if there is a proper directory record, the digital content may not be able to connect (cunningham, 2005).

""book a class"" button is also a very efficient way to stimulate customers decision so it is a very smart choice in architecture and function point of view. one thing i would suggest to be considered for changing is to add opening hours and address of the fitness center in the end or beginning of the website so that it is easier for customers to view.

i strongly agree with your point of view and think that your entry point on the impact or limitation of virtual reference services is unique. when it comes to the transformation from physical reference services, people's first reaction is mostly the advantages, such as increase of efficiency, more convenience, and more environmentally friendly due to replacing paper, but theres a common problem that is often ignored, that is, the attitude and patience of the user and the librarian that you proposed. in face-to-face communication, eyes and body language may play a nice role in expressing questions clearly, which facilitates librarians to understand users needs better and faster. however, this advantage may disappear when it transforms into virtual reference services. indeed, the communication attitude between the two parties may become less active as the abstraction and complexity of the question increase, users may be annoyed since they get the answers that they need but still spend time to communicate with librarians, while librarians may still not understand the users problems well, or some valuable information cannot be sent to users online, for example, because of technical or copyright restrictions.",1,F,MANDARIN

"on our approach to the first question: we part from similar definitions of research: they both consider the methods of analysis, the materials that are analysed, and the conclusions that are drawn. in my explanations, i try to explain how these characteristics are present in different scientific fields. in your approach, i notice a similar pattern: in computer science, for example, you explain the distinction between proof-based computer science and industrial-type research based on iterative processes (you contrast the methods of analysis). we both also explain what kind of applications and results these methods yield. 
by contrast, we consider very different products in the innovation task. while i chose a very new development which shows some moderate promise and has sparked some controversy, your selection of an eeg cap i feel better highlights what we really mean by innovation: products that enable further innovation, with the base case of this interestingly recursive definition being an innovation that changes society substantially (note, this recursive property is far from perfect, it is perfectly plausible for an innovation to be considered a base case and still lead to further innovation, but i think my point can be made relatively clearly). 
lastly, it is very difficult to compare our approaches to task 3. your approach seems to be to explain how three individual sources describe the impact of ai research and innovation on society. while i began in a similar way, i found it interesting to compare these sources in their levels of dystopian prediction and notice that the less academically based a source is, the more dystopian its predictions tend to be, because extremes sell and fear sells.

"i assume in your case, you have dropped all tables from your database, so if you run again the drop clause, there is no table named gallery to drop so it shows the error you mentioned, and it's totally ok. (if only the error shows after the drop clause)
the reason why we should put drop clauses for all tables because it gives convenience to the markers to run our script on their database which might have tables with same name created from other students.

 perform the prime factorization of each number then write it in exponential form. align the common prime factor base whenever possible.
 for the numbers with a common prime factor base, select the prime number that has the highest power. the prime factor with the highest power implies that it occurs the most in the entire list.
 if a distinct prime factor has no matching prime factor base in the list, immediately include this factor with its exponent in the collection of numbers that you will multiply later.
to determine the least common multiple (lcm), multiply all the numbers that you have collected or gathered from steps #2 and #3.

the redesign is a huge improvement from the original. the most effective information architecture change is the new header and the footer. you moved the logo onto the heading make it more noticeable than what is on the original. i also like the simple navigation menus on the header. the original webpage doesn't have a footer, adding the footer in made the redesign more modern and professional.
moving on the overall design. i really like the new way you organize the page. the original webpage is poorly organize, i.e. having logo onto the size, and very inconsistence in font sizes and colors. the redesign have consistence fonts, fonts colors and sizes. the main color you used was  grey, which is a good thing, it gives the luxury vibes to the page.

the process of finding and evaluating resources can present varying challenges depending on the existing skill and experience of users. when researching a new assignment topic, users information literacy can vary widely and so can the ability to locate resources and determine if they are accurate, current or of sufficient depth to be useful in an assignment.
one area of potential weakness in information literacy is in identifying subject search terms. the course material may provide some basic background information, but locating more in depth resources can require additional knowledge of the subject to be able to identify the most useful keywords that are specific to the topic or discipline (bundy, 2004). monash university library provides some generic classes during semester to develop information literacy skills, and some units also have specialised classes delivered both in the library or during lectures. however, these could potentially work on a one size fits all approach, and may not address gaps in information literacy specific to the student. on the other hand, the library provides a more specialised approach through drop in sessions where students can discuss their assignment research needs with a librarian or learning skills advisor.
the individual drop in sessions are typically a 15 minute consultation, which places a number of restrictions. due to time constraints, there can be a trade-off between assisting with searches for relevant information, and actually educating users in improving their information literacy skills. additional time is sometimes also needed to understand the users queries. the way libraries improve methods to develop users information literacy is an ongoing process that continuously needs to undergo review so that it addresses users effectively.

"discuss saras criminal liability, if any, in relation to hugo and ellen. [16 marks]

set out the possible common law and statutory offences with which s could be charged.


remember to raise arguments for the prosecution and defence that support and/or negate the elements of the particular offence.


for each charge come to a (tentative) conclusion as to whether sara could be found guilty.

common law offences:

battery (pulling of hugos hair and throwing of coffee in ellens face)


assault (threat of ill gouge your eyes out)

statutory offences:

section 18 causing injury intentionally or recklessly (though most likely recklessly)


section 21- threats to inflict serious injury (threat of ill gouge your eyes out)



offence


ar


mr


defence


conclusion


assault


the threat of ill gouge your eyes out
(voluntary action)


intentionally causing fear in ellen


hugo initiated the contact and thus it was;
self-defence- sara was not actually intending to follow through with the threat, but rather had said it to instil fear in ellen, so that she and her kid would leave the vicinity.


in the circumstance it appears, ellen could have reasonably believed that sara was going to follow through with her threat and escalate the situation again, given the abuse demonstrated before this (sara pulling hugos hair), and thus, sara is likely to be found guilty of assault.


battery


pulling of hugos hair and throwing of coffee in ellens face (voluntarily action, free will)


recklessly causing harm for hugo. sara would be able to foresee that the consequences of her actions are probable, given the circumstances.
intentional for the coffee. by throwing the coffee sara clearly intended to cause at the very least fear and possibly discomfort to ellen


self - defence for both. however in the case of hugo, the force used was disproportionate to the force being applied by hugo. sara is a grown adult, and hugo is a three-year-old child. he could not have reasonably comprehended the harm he may cause tina, nor could the harm be the same as what sara caused him. there were other ways of removing hugo without harming him.
for the coffee could say self-defence as ellen has been yelling at her. although, ellens yelling is a response to the harm sara has caused to hugo. additionally no physical harm was actually caused by the coffee.


sara is likely to be found guilty of battery against hugo.
sara is likely to be found guilty of battery for the coffee, because no actual injury is required, just the infliction of unlawful force.


s. 18 - causing injury intentionally or recklessly


pulled hugos hair and threw coffee in ellens face (voluntary action that caused injury)


recklessly caused the injury to hugo. she would have been able to reasonably foresee her actions were probable to cause him injury. intentionally caused injury to ellen as sara had the purpose to throw her coffee in her face.


sara did not cause injury to ellen in throwing the coffee in her face.


sara will likely be found guilty of recklessly causing injury towards hugo as the voluntary act of pulling his hair out resulted in both physical and mental (three stitches and becoming nervous around strangers) injury that she could reasonably foresee. it is unlikely however that sara will not be found guilty of intentionally causing injury towards ellen as the intentional act of throwing the coffee in her face did not cause her physical or mental damage.


s. 21 - threat to inflict serious injury


told ellen ill gouge your eyes out
(voluntarily action).


had the intention to instill fear in ellen


sara was not intending to follow through on this threat. it was made in self-defence to prompt ellen and hugo to leave.


in these circumstances, it appears that ellens threat to inflict serious injury on sara intending that sara would fear that the threat will be carried out. for this reason it is likely that sara be charged with threat to inflict serious injury.



prosecution:

injury caused: hugo needed 3 stitches and has long lasting psychological harm becomes very nervous around strangers and clingy towards his mother.


given the age of hugo, such force is not necessary to escalate the situation. furthermore, hugo is more vulnerable to be severely psychologically affected by this incident, potentially impacting his future abilities.


as hugo is likely unaware that his actions would cause serious harm due to his age and had the intention to help tina, saras action would be disproportionate


the courts need to outline to society that excessive violence is not acceptable, especially due to hugos age.

"here are my answers to the best of my ability, i got stuck on a couple of questions and will after posting look at the discussion answers and update my notes. 
im sorry if this is no use to anybody as the discussion has already taken place, but i'm hoping it will give some insight. 

1) what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?
just punishment: at the time of this case, brown was accused of committing a wrongdoing whereby their private acts were considered as being harmful to one another, despite consent being involved. 
deterrence: this was done to prevent anybody else from committing sadomasochistic acts even done privately and where there is consent. 
rehabilitation: to show brown that these acts are morally wrong and will not be accepted by the law when there is bodily harm caused to the victim. through the punishment, this also communicated to the broader community that this will not be tolerated. 
denunciation: as these sexual acts were considered extremely shameful at the time, 
protection of the community:
protection of the community: through telling the community that these acts will not be tolerated and therefore acting as a deterrence, less people will be undergoing sadomasochistic acts for sexual pleasure, therefore shielding more members of the community from the possibility of bodily harm through it. 

2) what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?
prevention of harm: acts that cause harm to others will be punished in relevance to the severity of the crime/harm done. 
it was thought that the homosexual masochistic activities between the men caused enough bodily injury harm to warrant punishment. 
due to the presence of consent, it was thought that the judgement reached was a result of moral disapproval of the acts, rather than prevention of harm.
morality: what a right-minded person considers to be right or wrong. at the time of the case, it is likely that many people could agree that these sadomasochistic activities were a moral wrong. 
the public interest: to protect people from themselves, even when done privately. despite consent, these harms are considered an inarguable wrongdoing, and the people who agree to it do not know any better and must therefore be protected by the law.

3) should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

4) should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?
criminal law should theoretically reflect moral beliefs, to promote adherence to the law. 
as time progresses, so do peoples values and morals, and the law should change to remain relevant. it can be argued that in the case of r v brown, many people may have still held displeasing views toward homosexual acts, and this may have clouded judgement. 
societies values are different today relating to both homosexuals and sadomasochism. 
for example, many people enjoy the act of choking during consensual sex, and this will seldom be a case of sadomasochism in todays criminal courts.

"initial assessment of the existence or likelihood of family violence during a pre-mediation interview with ms jones should have been a strong indicator of the inappropriateness of mediation in the present case. based on the information provided there wereat least 5 of the 11 indicators commonly cited in the literature present to support the likelihood that homicide will occur in the futureincluding; threats of homicide, access to a weapon, being separated, having access to ms jones and her son, and ms jones having contacted law enforcement. these indicators alongside ms jones own testimony in regards to the presence of family violence and concern for her sons safety in her ex-partners care, should have been a sufficient evidence to support the assessment that mediation is not appropriate given the present threat of violence.

in addition, the mediator also failed to appropriately determine whether ms jones had provided genuine and informed consent to participate in mediation. this is supported by the fact that ms jones was unable to choose to litigate as a result of a lack of financial resources despite this being her preference and more appropriate in the circumstances. ms jones financial situation also meant that she was more likely to feelcoerced into reaching an agreement during mediationwhich she ultimately felt was unsafe for her son. this would have been exacerbated by the power imbalance which exists between the parties as a result of years of violence, coercion and control.

ms jones experience suggests that the mediator lacked the specialised skills and knowledge necessary to make an assessment of the suitability of mediation in circumstances of family violence, as well as the expertise to assess the overall safety of ms jones and her sonfollowing separation. mediation has resulted in ms jones and her son experiencing an injustice not only in terms of the process but also its outcomes. the mediator should have issued ms jones a certificate of exception undersection 60j of the family law act 1975 (cth).

"hi all,
i thought it would be a good idea to discuss the approach adopted by english courts and examine the suitability of this 'all or nothing approach.' (:
it seems that the tort of negligence in does offer compensation in some circumstances for a lost chance of financial gain 
but in respect of personal injury or in cases of medical negligence, the law seems to be more uncertain and controversial.

before jumping to the discussion, i will briefly outline the facts of these two cases to use as illustrations for my points.
hotsonv berkshire area health authority
in this case, the likelihood of the plaintiff's femoral epiphysis developing into avascular necrosis was assessed at 75%. 
as a result of the late diagnosis (5 days delay), there was a loss of a 25% chance. 
the plaintiff was initially compensated for that 25% loss of chance.
the health authority of this case did appeal to the house of lord which later upheld the traditional ""all or nothing approach.""

is it reasonable that the claimant should bear the risk of lack of evidence where the ds breach has removed the opportunity of obtaining that evidence?
grey v scott
the doctor in this case also misdiagnosed, stating that the claimant's lump was only a collection of fatty tissue, having failed to refer the claimant to the hospital. 
as a result, the plaintiff's cancerous lymphomas' treatment was delayed by around 9 months and the chance of making full recovery was diminished from around 42% to 24%. 
the claim was dismissed on the basis that ""because they were less than 50% he can recover nothing."" (lord nicholls dissenting). 
by a 3-2 majority, this appeal was dismissed and the court upheld the ""all or nothing approach""

discussion of the ""all or nothing approach""
assuming that the statistics and assessment of chance are correct, there are a number of issues associated with this approach. lord nicholls, in my opinion, made a fairly strong argument against this approach. he stated the loss of a 45% prospect of recovery is just as much a real loss for a patient as the loss of a 55% prospect of recoveryand expressed his view that the patient should have a right to a remedy even if the prospect was less than 50-50 (grey v scott). to reinforce this, lord nicholls quotedherskovits v group health co-operative of puget sound""to decide otherwise would be a blanket release from liability for doctors and hospitals any time there was less than 50% chance of survival, regardless of how flagrant the negligence"". the minority view did not feel bound to follow this all or nothing approach.i believe that this approach undermines the fundamental aims of tort law, including the compensation for plaintiffs and deterrence of the wrongdoer. regardless of what that chance might be, a loss of chance does injure a person and that person should be compensated accordingly.
admittedly, the houston case is not the best example to support this as there was insufficient evidence which affected the outcome of the case. lord mackay at 915 addressed the flaw of the assessment of chance stating that it depends on whether or not sufficient blood cells were left intact by the fall. while the main reason behind the house of lords' decision was that causation was not clearly established, it does seem a bit arbitrary that houston had to go home empty-handed. after all, the misdiagnosis did injure the claimant.
the majority includinglord hoffmann, lord phillips and baroness hale upheld the traditional principle on the basis that causality needs to be established on balance of probabilities, therefore the requirement of a 50% loss of chance is necessary. this is consistent with the principles of negligence and also would make the application of the law much easier. per baroness hale, ""the introduction of liability for loss of a chance in medical negligence cases would mean unpredictability and complexity for the law of personal injury and again thought that the denial of a remedy to mr gregg was a price worth paying for the certainty and simplicity of the all-or-nothing balance of probabilities approach.""perhaps, it is also unreasonable to make the defendant bear the costs when causation cannot be established.
there is probably no perfect way to deal with this because, without the all-or-nothing approach, the outcome of cases can be uncertain - it is probably impossible to accurately assess the prospects of a patient in medical cases. adopting this approach, on the other hand, may lead to patients with real injuries go home empty-handed and will fail to deter doctors who acted negligently.

"hi ellen and everyone, 
thanks for your great points. re the case study, thats pretty much my view! 
you make a good point of the need to ascertain whether the employees were acting in their capacity as, for example, a director/officer  
im not too sure what the case would be if they were acting outside the scope of their duties.  

you make insightful points about employer liability for employees in other circumstances such as fraud and fiduciary duty. 
to an extent, i agree with your views on the employers ability to develop policies and procedures and their ability to create a workplace culture. 
im not too sure if this means that employers should have stronger vicarious liability for bsd. 

what happens in circumstances where the employer has such policies and procedures in place, but the employee refuses to follow such policies? 
in millington v wilkie plumbing services,the court held that where an employer is put in breach of a statutory duty by reason of conduct of an employee 
and has done nothing to contribute to the breach, the employee has no cause of action for breach as s/he is excluded from the classes of persons 
for whose benefit the statutory duty was imposed. 

here, the statutory duty was imposed on the employer, but i think a similar argument can be raised if the statutory duty was placed on the employee, 
i.e. in absence of any fault on the employer, s/he shouldnt be vicariously liable for bsd of the employee.  
that being said, i also agree with everyones view above that it is definitely important to ascertain the intention of parliament 
when discerning whether or not a vicarious employer can be held liable for an employees bsd. 
perhaps vicarious liability should be determined on a case-by-case basis  thoughts?

"the issue here is whether the phone call was an offer or an invitation to treat. generally, if there is a clear intention for the offeror to be bound by acceptance, and if the offeree has the option to reject, it may be an offer. as sarah has made her willingness to sell the table to her brother clear over the telephone, and has given him the option of declining, it appears that this would be an offer. the intended offeree is specific, making sarah's contractual intentions more apparent. therefore, due to the clear nature of the call, it appears that sarah has made an offer.",1,F,ENGLISH

i found this a little complex but the main issue at trial was whether evidence derived from a police officer's incorrectly sworn affidavit was admissible (held it was inadmissible).

"hi everyone,

while doing the readings for this week, i noticed a few patterns i thought were quite interesting.

firstly, most of the cases that deal with this particular area of tort law appear to be actions brought for a breach of statutory duty. in particular,bonnington castings v wardlaw [1956],nicholson v atlas steel foundry[1957],mcghee v national coal board[1973],wilsher v essex area health authority[1988],fairchild v glenhaven funeral services[2003] andsienkiewicz v grief[2011]were all actions brought partly for a breach of statutory duty, and most of the plaintiffs were employees bringing an action against their employer.

secondly, i noticed that the the plaintiffs overwhelmingly complain of medical harm suffered, in particular, disease related harm. in the majority of cases discussed in the readings, the harm suffered by the plaintiff generally falls under asbestos related disease or cancer, however, even in the cases not involving asbestos, such aswilsher, the harm suffered was still a medical disease.

thirdly, i wanted to highlight the uncertainty with this principles which have been established and debated in this area of law, particularly in the uk. while the house of lords, in particular, has established certain principles or exceptions to the normal 'but for' causation test, their honours have been reluctant to uniformly outline how this doctrine works, or how it might be used in future cases.

while this problem may be solved in future litigation, another problem lies within the difficulty to prove factual causation. the cases provide examples as to where there is problematic factual causation, for example, inbonnington, where both machines may have materially contributed to the risk of harm occurring, only one source may have been tortious, however. in this case, the employer was still held liable for a certain amount of tortious exposure to the harm resulting in injury. this means, therefore, that although there were multiples sources of exposure, which could equally lead to the harm eventuating, the house was still prepared to establish liability in spite of difficult factual causation.
this is an interesting contrast withwilsher, whereby the house found that the defendant did not owe a duty of care where there was difficulty in factual causation, particularly in establishing which of several actions may have caused the harm. the house held that, while the breach of statutory duty by the defendant may have increased the material risk of harm, or contributed directly to the harm, it is not reasonable to impose liability, as there were several other possible (indivisible) exposures which may have also resulted in the harm.
i wanted to highlight these two cases as they seem to deal with similar principles, being the factual causation in establishing which source of indivisible tortious behaviour or exposure materially contributed or caused the harm, and to what extend should the defendant be held liable. the house of lords held that there was liability in the former, but not in the latter, however.

i find the reading material covering this topic offer quite a broad range of views and opinions, some of which endorse the principles established by the cases and others that highlight the uncertainty as a critical flaw.
i found the readings to be quite interesting as a result of the divide that exists within the community of scholars, and i am interested to hear any thoughts others may have about this topic.

thanks!

"unlawful dangerous act manslaughter (uda manslaughter), gross negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter by omission
ar
voluntariness- ellen chose to stab him of her own volition, provocation is no longer a defence to prevent this finding, so rons behaviour is not relevant here.
causation- it could be argued that the doctors broke the causation, causing rons death. he did not die from the stab wounds, but it was the failure to diagnose the medical complication that arose, which ultimately lead to his death, following r v jordan (1956)
however, it can be said that there is causation. the complications of the surgery may have resulted in death, however it did not accelerate the death, meaning it does not break the chain of causation, as stated in r v evans &amp; gardiner (no 2) [1976].
death of a human - ron was a human, and is now dead. thus the element is fulfilled.

unlawful act - stabbing somebody is illegal. her intent to stab ron can be made out by the fact that she lunged at him and stabbed him multiple times.
dangerous act - it is dangerous to repeatedly stab someone
(uda manslaughter)

duty of care- ron was her spouse, thus she had a duty of care.
(negligent manslaughters)
duty of carein common law duty of care can be established because of a family relationship (married)

omission - she didn't call the ambulance until 10 minutes after the fact. this would allow his wounds to deteriorate, and could reasonably be seen to result in death, as he needed aid. her omission in not contacting medical services was a voluntary omission. as he was her husband, and in danger, it was a duty to assist him.

mr
intention- she actively intended to cause the uda. thus there is intention needed for uda.
negligence (gross)
she stabbed him, intending to stop him. she did not take adequate care to ensure his safety, or stop him in a safer manner, thus breaching the duty of care without regard to his safety. she should have known it could cause serious injury and it merits punishment, as it was a direct attack.
a reasonable person her age would understand that it could do so, however they may consider it a reasonable, albeit illegal, action and hence not negligence given the circumstance of tension and fear.
this was a great falling short of the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in her circumstances (nydam).
negligence (omission)
as she stabbed him and saw him bleeding, she should call ambulatory services. regardless of if they are alive or dead, a reasonable person would be expected to call an ambulance. however, given the shock and grief of such an action it could be argued that it is not unreasonable to assume he was dead, until witnessing the movement. if that is so, she immediately called the services, and thus may not be considered negligent.
however, most likely it would be determined that she should have called the ambulance immediately, and thus is a negligent omission.

conclusion
ellen would reasonably be convicted of all if charged, however she is most likely to be charged under, and most likely to be found guilty of, uda manslaughter.

"hi kat, alfie and others,
i completely agree with both of you - and maxwell p in giller v procopets - that damages should be allowed for 'mere' emotional distress. i'm really not sure that the traditional restrictive approach of the courts is justified:

1. courts have been reluctant to award damages for emotional distress due to valuation and assessment difficulties. however, surely this issue could be overcome: the assignment of non-pecuniary losses can take place within the framework of some official or unofficial tariff (ie range of acceptable awards), for instance. and in practical terms, compensation for non-pecuniary losses should only strive to be fair, reasonable and just rather than full (as tilbury points out in his 2010 article). 

2. another justification for the restrictive approach is that there are problems of proof, which make it very difficult to identify which claims are genuine and which are exaggerated. a related concern is that the litigation 'floodgates' will open, as alfie notes. however, both of these justifications are questionable. us jurisdictions have permitted recovery for 'severe emotional harm' for about 50 years. according to anthony gray's 2015 article, the actual us experience is that the tort has been little used, and is certainly not being used to make spurious claims. the requirements that the emotional harm be 'severe', and that the defendant's conduct be 'extreme and outrageous', are likely to act as sufficient controls. 

3. the restrictive approach has also been justified on the basis that emotional distress is 'short-lived' or 'fleeting', while psychiatric injury is longer-lasting. however, as both of you note, the bright line distinction between 'emotional distress' and 'psychiatric harm' has been widely criticised. medical science acknowledges that there is a spectrum of harm, which makes it difficult to identify a sudden cut-off point where distress suddenly becomes 'fleeting'. 

4. finally, the restrictive approach has also been justified on the grounds that emotional distress is a harm of lesser significance compared to other harms (eg physical harm, property damage, financial loss). i think this is a highly outdated view. in modern times, the community recognises emotional wellbeing, happiness and dignity as interests that are worthy of strong protection. i think this is especially important considering the advent of social media - where cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour in online fora is remarkably common (but thankfully, not in this one). 

anyway, those are my thoughts. i'd be interested to hear anyone else's thoughts - does anyone think that the restrictive approach can still be justified?

"hey guys,
given that the large majority of workplaces have employees working from home (wfh) now, do you think this has the potential to lead to several cases of privacy breaches in the near future?

an issue of wfh that workplaces are currently facing is how employees can securely access the workplace's database from their personal devices at home, 
withoutjeopardising the security of those databases (e.g. hacking, other household members seeing confidential information etc). 

a few examples that i've heard of recently come to mind. 
for example, i was recently doing placement at a community legal centre that had all its clients' details and documents on their database. 

to access them, we'd have to go into the centre and use the computers there.
 at the start of the outbreak, i they were really concerned about having students/staff access files from home 
and having confidential client information being seen by family members/housemates. 

another example is someone i know who works for a government department and is currently wfh a few days a week. 
people in this position must make calls and write documents with confidential information in them, 
and whilst they should have a private workplace to prevent others from hearing, i could imagine that this is not practical for every household.

with these arrangements, i'd imagine that there would be some cases of privacy leaks/breaches for workplaces 
that don't have strong security measures in place and/or employees following these measures. 

i don't know much about the technology side of things, but i guess that this would be an opportune time for hackers to seek out confidential information in some way! 
an example of a workplace already taking action on this issue is the australian defence force recently banning the use of zoom for work meetings 
as they were weary of the information shared in their meetings not being secure.

if anyone has thoughts on this, or has a background/interest in technology feel free to share your thoughts! would love to hear them :)

"workshop task 1  r v brown
topic 1 task:
answer the following questions, referring to r v brown [1994] 1 ac 212 and noting the differences between the majority and minority views of the lords (judges) in that case:

1. what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?
section 5(1) of the sentencing act 1991 (vic) establishes the purposes of sentencing as being: just punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and community protection. the purpose of punishment can generally be described as a means of protecting the public interest. the concept of fairness and equality under the law  which may be argued as underlying principles in our society  are upheld through the pursuit of justice in punishment. this allows for the possibility of retributive resolution for injured persons, though also aims to consistently and proportionally apply the law in all instances.

furthermore, denunciation provides a clearly defined legal framework of societal values  outlining community opposition to objectionable behaviour. this, paired with the threat of punishment, aims to deter such behaviour from occurring in the first place. on the occasion that individuals do commit offences against these community guidelines, rehabilitative avenues are made available to address such behaviour  ideally removing contributing factors and preventing reoffences from occurring. in this sense, both deterrence and rehabilitation are forms of community protection; however, in serious cases, a sentence may be passed to remove an individual from society and more completely protect the community from being subjected to further harm.

when applied to r v brown [1994] 1 ac 212, the majority judgment appeared to most concern itself with the denunciation of sadomasochistic activities. all judges who ruled to punish the men, in one way or another, condemned their behaviour as undesirable and contrary to societal interests. lord templeman argued that society was entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. this can be read as appealing to the interest of community protection, along with denouncing the behaviour which he describes as a cult of violence. ruling to apply a sanction to sadomasochistic behaviour will also, by default, act to deter others from engaging in similar activities.

these three aims of punishment also apply to the two other members of the majority judgment, with lord jauncey arguing that there was a possibility of corruption befalling young men, and lord lowry stating that sado-masochistic homosexual activity was at odds with the enhancement or enjoyment of family life or conducive to the welfare of society.

there appeared to be little concern for rehabilitation in this instance, and the dismissal of consent as a valid defence or significant mitigating factor can in fact be argued as conflicting to the principle of just punishment. to rule that consensual sadomasochistic acts between adult partners are indistinguishable from malicious wounding and assault occasioning actual bodily harm ignores important distinctions in harm inflicted, the motive behind it and the manner in which it was done. this does not appear to uphold the principles of fair and proportional punishment  essential features of justice.

2.what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?
a person subscribed to natural law theory would argue that there are innate laws and morals within human nature which the man-made law should seek to replicate. however, a positivist approach would argue that laws are merely reflective of the interests of whichever societal higher-ups wield influence.
a libertarian approach, which values (above all else), individual freedom and liberty, would limit the application of criminal law to instances where one person injures another (john stewart mills harm principle). those subscribed to libertarianism would argue that the values behind criminal law ought to be freedom  maximising a persons individual autonomy, though also protecting them and their property from outside interference. this approach would not see protective laws issued towards protecting the self (eg. laws regulating substance use, self-harm.) libertarianism aims to uphold the value of freedom, even if this means the freedom for one to engage in self-destructive behaviour.
the alternative would see a paternalistic approach invoked  where the criminal law takes a more intrusive approach into ones life. paternalistic laws seek to protect individuals from themselves as well as others. it could be argued that the paternalistic approach is motivated by the value of maximising human health, happiness and prosperity  even if this intrudes on ones personal autonomy or contravenes their self-interest.
another approach, moralism, seeks to uphold the views of the community. this might see either/both individual liberty and human prosperity subverted for the purpose of reflecting societal ideals. it may be argued that the moralistic approach best correlates with democratic values  arguing that the majority should outline the principle which the criminal law should reflect.

in the r v brown case, there is a distinct difference in values between the majority judgment and minority judgment. the majority judges leaned very heavily towards paternalistic and/or moralistic approach. as earlier mentioned, lords templeman, jauncey and lowry all appealed to societal interests in their judgments. it was argued that sadomasochism was a violent and corrupting behaviour, conducive to the welfare of society. a moralistic approach, which seeks to protect community interests and values, dominates the majority ruling. additionally, lord jaunceys statement, which argues that the young men may be corrupted by consensual sadomasochistic acts leans into a paternalistic approach  aiming to protect these men from themselves, contravening their own desires supposedly for their own benefit.
the minority judgment, however, seemed motivated by libertarian ideals. lord mustill argued that the state should interfere in an individuals life no more than is necessary to ensure a proper balance between the special interests of the individual and the general interests of the individuals who together comprise the populace at large. this seems to adhere to mills harm principle, with mustill arguing that interference into individual liberty must be restricted unless absolutely necessary. it is also quite apparent that mustill takes a far more individualistic approach to the law, often referring in his judgment to isolate persons rather than the collective society cited by the majority judges.

the other dissenting judge, lord slynn, is not so firm in his convictions  refusing to condemn the men, though arguing that the matter should be left for the legislature to decide. in this way, he mirrors the approach of the majority judges, in that he appeals to the moral convictions of society to decide the matter. however, he is hesitant to rule on matters done in private  drawing a distinction between consensual sexual behaviour and common assault which is not found in the statements of the majority judges. he also exhibits a reluctance for the criminal courts to interfere in private matters  something obviously absent in the majority ruling.

3.should crimes vary between jurisdictions?
there are strong arguments both for and against expanding legal jurisdictions to unify the law within a country (or even further). if taking a human rights approach (arguing from a natural law framework), it can be said that all people are entitled to basic human rights. this position is already supported (supposedly) by the many countries who voted in favour of non-binding human rights charters/conventions put forward by the un, such as the universal declaration of human rights. however, as it stands, there is no uniform law protecting basic human rights in all australia, let alone worldwide. it can be argued that it is inherently flawed and unequal for a doctor providing voluntary euthanasia services to a terminally ill patient in queensland to be prosecuted under criminal law when the same practice is perfectly legal in victoria. there is an expectation that as australian citizens, each resident within the country ought be treated equally under the law and not be privileged/disadvantaged by ones location. we could apply a libertarian framework to this argument and say that it is unjust and an assault on ones individual liberty for one legal jurisdiction to inflict greater restrictions and harsher punishments on one community compared to their neighbours.

we could apply these arguments to the r v brown case, as it can be argued as unjust if the men be persecuted for behaviour that is perfectly legal in other jurisdictions. if other countries had more liberal laws regarding private sexual encounters, a libertarian might argue that the courts exhibited unjust overreach and violated the mens freedoms in an unethical way. this argument may be especially applicable to the r v brown case considering the wide disparity in social attitudes and laws regulating homosexual activity across europe at the time. perhaps if there was an expanded jurisdiction which guaranteed consistent human rights protections across countries/states, allowing consenting adults guaranteed sexual freedoms  the men would have not been punished and they would be guaranteed equal freedoms to those living elsewhere.

however, there is a practical argument to having more localised laws. a moralist, firstly, may argue that upholding community values (which may differ between cultures/countries/jurisdictions) is of utmost importance and the criminal law should be able to differ between jurisdictions to accordingly meet such requirements. in this sense, it could be considered unjust for a large portion of people to live under laws which they disagreed with simply so that the law may be applied more consistently to a greater number of people. it may be argued to be undemocratic and oppressive to force a majority of people to live by laws they hold strong disagreements to and find morally objectionable. in this case, the law would not fulfil its purpose of accurately representing the views and values of society. 

returning to the r v brown case, the majority judgment stated that the behaviour of the men contravened community interests. saying that these men were in fact members of this community (the society in which they lived) and potentially had some type of an impact on this community, it is not beyond reasonable expectations that they reflect community values in their behaviour and refrain from violating this unspoken social contract.

additionally, different communities may have special needs depending on their location and demographic makeup. to mandate a singular criminal law across all jurisdictions would arguably paint with too broad a brush and tie the hands of courts to enforce the law in a manner most effective in addressing issues in their communities. this might play into a paternalistic framework  which would seek to protect the public above all else.for example, even if a law against sadomasochistic conduct impugned on individual freedoms, it may be justified by a paternalistic approach if a specific jurisdiction was facing a worrying number of injuries or infections as a result of the behaviour. an increase in hospitalisations and transmittable health-related issues would be a concern not only for the individuals involved but would also impact on the community as a whole. in a case such as this, it could be argued a necessity to regulate certain behaviours to maintain public wellbeing. however, if sadomasochistic conduct was proven harmless to the community in other jurisdictions, the law may deem it permissible. more localised jurisdiction could hereby allow for courts to exercise a care for individual liberty when possible, though still be free to exercise targeted paternalistic measures when deemed necessary.

4. should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?
the law is created with the intent to reflect community views and values, to safeguard the community. the law sets a range of boundaries which are set to prevent harm to everyone. these boundaries are set to ensure the community behaviour is monitored in accordance with the law. however, the law's focus is to ensure that the community views and values are embedded within the law, for the community to accept and follow the law. as community views about particular topics change over time, the law should too. what was considered a crime in the past due to community values and majority, sometimes no longer reflects the present values and beliefs. an example of this would be the shift in the community values against homosexuality. the community has come into terms with accepting individuals' right to express their sexuality.

with regard to r v brown [1994] 1 ac 212 (brown), the appeal was dismissed as the focus was supposedly upon consent, where the homosexual appellant(s) cannot give consent to a degree where the kings peace is disrupted. limitation of consent was strictly upheld in browns case, however, in a similar case where bodily harm is inflicted for sexual desire/purpose within a heterosexual couple, consent was accepted as a defence. in r v wilson [1997] qb 47, a wife can consent to her husband to imprint his initials on her buttocks with a hot knife, creating equivalent harm to the victim. browns case concludes with the implicit moral disapproval of homosexual conduct during the 1990s. now, the community values have changed in regard to homosexuality and other sexual representations. thus, the laws that incriminate or incriminated sexual conduct between homosexuals or lgbtqi+ communities no longer apply within our legal system.

community views and value shifting from being absolutely against homosexual conducts to eventually accepting such conducts proves the point that incriminated offences within the legal system should change with the time. however, it is also necessary to not constantly change laws in mere inconveniences as it can engender inconsistency and chaos within the justice system. laws should only change particular offences incriminated when the societal views change, and the change is so significant that it impacts the communitys coherency if not altered or revoked.

"brief sentence answers just to encapsualte the gist of my thinking-  2a) offer is no longer open for acceptance because sarah revoked it before the specified period of 4pm expired, and her brother had not accepted the offer in the meantime.  b)the specified period of the offer being available for acceptance ended at 4pm, so the offer had lapsed at 4pm  c) it will still be open unless sarah accepts this offer proposed by her brother.",1,F,ENGLISH
"thank you for the answer. i want to say yes and no which is quite unsatisfying. if the law was always so clear we wouldn't need lawyers and judges to interpret it and there would be no appelate system. there are certainly some written rules that are so clear that almost no judge would have a different interpretation of it.  yet, because our laws are made in a general and not case-related way, you have to include abstract, not difined terms in them to make the law applicable to any case. and this is where there is a lot of room for interpretation.  i can give you the recent volkswagen cases as an example. volkswagen was the first automotive company to be detected by us authorities to have included a software mechanism which detects when the vehicles are on the road and when they are undergoing a performance test in the laboratory. therefore, the software makes some changes in the engine leading to less emission in the lab compared to the mode on the streets. the huge amount of civil law cases (we don't have class action proceedings) are decided completely different. some judges say that volkswagen commited fraud and was therefore liable to claims for damages and other courts hold the behavior didn't qualify for the threshold set out by the law and in comparison with former fraud cases.  in short, i sometimes wonder if the written law as in civil law systems is really that much clearer than common law.",1,F,GERMAN
"
what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?

there are many reasons for which individuals are punished for breaking the law, with no consensus on which specific justification is the most fitting. however, in victoria and the rest of australia, legislation has been passed, listing possible purposes of sentencing.

in the context of the r v brown [1994] 1 ac 212, the majority view bases their decision upon mainly part (a) and part (d). they established that there was harm committed and thus enacted a retributive punishment upon the accused men. additionally, the majority seeks to denounce the sadomasochistic behaviour of the men, aiming to protect society and uphold certain values.

 society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence
 (lord templeman)
 possibility of proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real danger
 (lord jauncey)
 sado-masochistic homosexual activity cannot be regarded as conducive to the enhancement or enjoyment of family life or conducive to the welfare of society  (lord lowry)




in contrast, the minority does not seek to punish the accused and doesn't require any purpose.


what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?

the principal values behind criminal law are:
- the prevention of harm
- vindication of public morality
- expression of legitimate public interest

the rationale of the prevention of harm related to the harm principle. this principle is based libertarian views of john stuart mill, and seeks to limit the power of the criminal law.

the only purpose for which power can be rightfully excerised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others

vindication of public morality 
lord devlin proposed in his book the enforcement of morals that a sense of common morality was crucial in maintaining the functioning of society. as such, morality should be enforced by the legal system. devlin supported the criminalisation of homosexuality.

expression of legitimate public interest or paternalism
hla hart, protect people from harm, even when the individual consents to it.


the judges of the majority view present paternalistic arguments, expressing public interest, seeking to protect the men from harm
 they state the risk of infection and serious injury.
-consent is not a valid defence.
-youth of the victims, use of drugs and alcohol, consent was dubious or worthless.


the majority also argue based on morality.
-cruelty is uncivilised.
proselytisation and corruption of young men implies that the actions are morally, leading to loss of religious values. 



should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

using the rationales for criminalisation crimes should vary between jurisdictions, reflecting the variance of moral values and held beliefs. the vast majority of jurisdictions with civilised communities, share the rationale of the prevention of harm. however, in contrast, cultural and religious differences in jurisdictions can lead to differing values and ethics. criminalisation should reflect or vindicate the beliefs of the constituents of a jurisdiction. 


should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?
crimes should change with the times and adapt to new societal conditions and norms. for example, in 19th century australia consensual homosexual sex was a crime. at the time, this criminalisation was considered to be just by the majority of society, as it vindicated the widely held moral values that homosexuality was a sin, rather than upholding the protection from harm. however, as time has progressed in australia, the societal aversion towards homosexuality has decreased significantly. as such, crimes based on consensual homosexual sex no longer represented the moral values of society, and thus was decriminalised. 

the decriminalisation of a crime should be decided by the consensus of society, through the passing of legislation. additionally, 

in regards to r v brown [1994] 1 ac 212, the difference between the majority and minority views are related to differing beliefs. it is argued that the majority view was based on prejudices against homosexuality. thus if this case had taken place a few years later, the homosexual sadomasochism may not be found to be a criminal offence.

however it could be argued that this is an offer by using the test in the electronic transactions act s14b. sarahs facebook post is not addressed to any specific party, and is generally accessible to facebook users. however she does state that the table must go and she will sell to the highest offer. this could indicate her intention to be bound if someone accepts.

"the conduct of the family reporter was highly inappropriate for a number of reasons. 
first, it seems that the reporter was not well informed as to the complexities of family violence, and how to respond to victim-survivors needs sensitively and appropriately. the reporter was inexperienced and underqualified. 
concerningly, he seemed unaware of the fact that victim-survivors may be re-traumatised by having to recount their experiences of violence. he made a number of insensitive comments to ms jones, including that her experience of violence was a matter of perception, and in his final report he characterised the violence situational (an apparent reference to the questionable kelly &amp; johnson typology). 
ms jones noted that these comments left her feeling as though her experience had been excused and trivialised.

further, and perhaps most concerningly, the reporter did not seem to take seriously ms jones credible and immediate fear for her and her sons safety. not only was this highly distressing for ms jones, but it also may have placed her and her son at risk, as she was not offered any advice or directed to any services that could have put them out of harms way.

given his relative lack of expertise in the area, it was troubling that the family court proceedings placed so much emphasis on the family report that he produced, which was ultimately significantly shaped by the reporters own subjective perceptions and opinions. ms jones refers to several moments in which she felt she had to moderate her behaviour, and withhold from criticising the reporters behaviour, so as not to put him offside. 

ms jones comment that the report he produced seemed to be highly subjective is consistent with the findings of a recent survey of family reporters conducted by the australian institute of family studies. the survey found that responses to a question asking whether they had changed their approach to making assessments since the family violence reforms, indicate a mixed picture, with 57% of the group responding in the negative, and nearly one-third (31%) answering in the affirmative. this would seem to indicate that the reporting practice lacks standardisation and oversight, and consequently reforms are not being implemented on the ground.

there are a number of ways in which the family reporting practice should be improved, but perhaps most urgently, there is a need to ensure that where there are allegations of family violence, more time and professional expertise should be allocated for assessment and for the writing of family reports. further, the reporters sessions with the parties should be audiovisually recorded. this would provide a mechanism whereby the reporters account of events can be corroborated, and would also foster greater accountability and oversight.",1,F,ENGLISH

"discuss ellens criminal liability, if any, in relation to rons death. [18 marks]
address only the murder aspect of the question.

ar elements:
reasonable creature in being:

ron has separate existence by virtue of functioning of its own organs, hence the element of reasonable creature in being is satisfied (attorney-generals reference (no 3 of 1994))

death:
on the facts, ron died: as per s.41 of the human tissue act.

under s.41 of the human tissue act 1982 (vic) death is now defined to mean either irreversible cessation of all functions of the brain or irreversible cessation of the circulation of the blood.


voluntariness:
ellen repeatedly stabbed ron, highlighting she had control over her actions and was an act of free will. thus there can be no doubt that she voluntarily acted.


furthermore, ellens act was not premeditated.

it can be argued by the defence that ellens actions were a reflex with regards to the circumstances (rons abuse and protection of her son) and thus did not voluntarily stab him (ryan v r (1967). however, given ellen stabbed ron three times, voluntariness is likely to be proven beyond reasonable doubt due to the fact she repeated her initial action.

causation:

ellen caused the injuries that ron acquired.


the prosecution would argue that without these injuries, ron would not have died.


the question is whether the negligence by the medical team broke the chain of causation


on one hand, the complication was common, so it would be expected as a result of ellens actions and the chain of causation would not be broken (r v evans and gardiner [1976])


on the other, the fact that it was so common could mean that the medical team should have been more vigilant: they should have diagnosed it within a time frame in which ron wouldnt die, thus making it that the medical teams actions could have overwhelmed the initial stabbing as the cause of death (r v jordan (1956)).

conclusion:

in these circumstances, it appears the requisite ar elements have been satisfied and the prosecutions argument would be the most likely to be upheld. although proving causation and voluntariness may be difficult to determine conclusively.


mr elements:
in these circumstances, the three possible situations of malice aforethought, the requisite mr element for murder as per coke, are intention to kill, intention to cause grievous bodily harm, and recklessly causing death or grievous bodily harm.
intention to kill:

a person is guilty of murder if he or she intends to kill the actual victim or some other person.


based on the facts of the case, ellen appears to not have premeditated her actions (meyers v r (1997)). the defence would argue that ellen stabbed ron to prevent any harm to her son.


in order to prevent the threat of any harm and stop any harm to the son the additional stabs to different parts of the body may not equate to the intention to kill.

furthermore, this coupled with the fact that ron was teasing her about her depression and anorexia and also giving ellen the knife could constitute an altered mental state where it could be argued by the defence that ellen did not intentionally kill ron.



thus, it is likely that the prosecution will not be able to convince the jury beyond reasonable doubt

intention to cause grievous bodily harm:

see above under intention to kill.


this mr is often coupled with recklessness as to death, and it is likely that would be the requisite mr for murder in this case.


recklessly causing death or grievous bodily harm:

the test is whether the accused knew the death or grievous harm was a probable (as opposed to possible) consequences of his or her conduct - as per crabbe.


foresight is accepted as a sufficient mental state for the person to be guilty of the offence of murder.


ellen contained the foresight that stabbing ron would probably cause him grievous bodily harm, thus satisfying that her behaviour was reckless.

only way out of this marriage is to use the knife according to ron  ellen foresaw that using a knife to stab him would cause harm



the defence could argue that it was an appropriate response to defending her child, thus not being an unlawful action

use of knife (excessive force) required to prevent ron from harming hugo get your hands off him, dont touch him.


perhaps due to ellens mental state of depression and anorexia, it can also be argued that ellen could not foresee the possible consequences of grievous bodily harm.


concomitance:

the act and intent must accompany each other. in this case it is likely that the act, stabbing ron three times, and the intent, which in this case the recklessness of ellen, occur at the same time.

tentative conclusion:

in this case, it appears ellen possessed the requisite elements of the ar and the required mr element of recklessly causing death or grievous bodily harm and thus, its likely that the prosecution would be able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that she is guilty of murder.

   be systematic  separate out the charges. address each offence and each complainant in turn.
   use headings for each of the ar and mr elements and any defence.
   remember to raise arguments for the prosecution and defence that support and/or negate the elements of the particular offence.
   for each charge come to a (tentative) conclusion as to whether sara could be found guilty.

intentionally causing injury ss.18 of the crimes act 1958

sara grabbing hold of hugos hair with force &gt; clumps of hair fall out, stitches


hugos clothes ripped


hugo - emotional damage = nervous, clingy. this may potentially lead to psychological harm (anxiety?)


external element
&gt; injury (yanking of head)
fault element
&gt; intention to hurt hugo by using terrific force

aggravating factors:

uses terrific force, excessive and out of proportion for disciplining a child


hurting a child


stitches in head &amp; emotional damage caused


clothes ripped


mitigating factors:

protecting her own child from harm


acting under time pressure and stress


sara will likely be found guilty however the defence does also have a case
threats to inflict serious injury ss. 21

sara threatening to gouge out eyes


apprehension of threat &gt; ellen is shaken and drags hugo away


external element&gt; threat of gouging eyes out
fault element
&gt; intention to scare

aggravating factors:

seven months pregnant - element of vulnerability


the extent of damage the serious injury would cause


adds onto the severity of the situation as she already hurt hugo, now there is a further threat of fear with no good reason


ellen is shaken


mitigating factors:

ellen shouting at sara / provoked


hugo injured tina - protective nature of sara coming out


sara should be found guilty.
assault, battery - s.31

throwing coffee into face (battery)


hugos head being hit (battery)


threat of gouging out eyes (assault)


external element&gt; throwing of coffee&gt; hugo hitting his head&gt; threat of gouging out eyes
fault element&gt; intention to hurt ellen and hugo&gt; fear that threat would be carried out - probability of harm

aggravating factors:

seven months pregnant


throwing coffee to hurt and provoke ellen, not to protect her child


hugo needing stitches &amp; emotional damage


choice of words brat


mitigating factors:

saras child being injured


ellen partially provokes sara


sara will most likely be found guilty of one count of assault for throwing the coffee, the charges relating to the threat and serious injury may not be charged as they have already been addressed.",1,M,ENGLISH

"indeed, training professionals to deal with family violence issues is extremely important. not only should the professional skills of employees be improved, but also the cultivation of their sense of service. improved professional skills allow judges and lawyers to deal with related matters efficiently and help victims get out of trouble as soon as possible. 

in addition, i strongly agree with what you said, the priority of any family violence process must be to have the concerns of victim / survivors properly heard. 
when i attend the book launch about this is how i will strangle you, what impressed me most is one word, trust. natasa christidou thanked her lawyer many times. because of the lawyer's company and encouragement, she developed trust in the lawyer. 

thus, she had the courage to state her experiences and even fight the aggressors. in real life, victims are psychologically fragile and often lack the courage to fight and persist. 
this requires relevant personnel to treat victims with a gentle attitude, guide them to tell their own experiences, and minimize the secondary injuries. 
therefore, in dealing with family violence issues, how to treat victims should be the most important content of training.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"hi alice,
i definitely agree with you when it comes to the coordinated ""fv"" approach. i feel that the one gap that you've consistently highlighted which outlines this is the distancing between the legal services provided by ms jones' counsel and the services that should have been made available subsequently to provide a more holistic outcome.
my main concern with this which you outlined as well is the safety of the child. ms jones' repeatedly highlighted that her legal team ignored her frustrations and opinions regarding her son's safety and never conducted a thorough risk assessment that would act as a platform to then compliment the legal proceedings. this parent led focus as opposed to the best interests and safety of the child really highlight the dangers and the way in which the legal system is failing families when cases like ms jones' are explored.
the advantage therefore of the collaborative comprehensive approach based around the first step being a risk assessment depicts that safety is already more of a priority than that of the traditional approach. the use of peripheral support people working together in their own strengths as psychologists, social workers, medical professionals and lawyers demonstrates clearly that this is a multi-faceted problem that cannot solely be addressed by the legal system.",1,F,ENGLISH

"i tend to agree with your post prue, 
given the nature of violence, a thorough risk assessment must have been made before mediation. this assessment would have identified the risks to ms jones, but more importantly, to her son. as was evident from her statement, her son was distressed and disoriented upon returning from visits with his father - this is something that could have been identified as a risk before the mediation orders were finalised. 
in combination with assistance from an independent children's lawyer, this would have identified significant potential risks to the child when visiting the father, or even outside the arrangement. as the child was under 10, a direct representation model would have been unavailable - instead, the best interests of her son would still have been identified and assessed with impartiality, and without the burden of involving her son at all.
i am not sure how i feel about a gender balance in mediation, given the need to accommodate two mediators which may overcomplicate things. an alternate view may be to have each party speak to a sperate mediator, where the mediators then arrange a solution - but this may then turn into a game of chinese whispers and the arrangement may be even worse!",1,F,ARABIC

"hi emilie,
what you said reminds me of the article the high court and the doctrine of precedent i just read. matthew harding said :the moral value of the doctrine of precedent is in the way it serves the political ideal of the rule of law; according to that ideal, institutions of the state, like courts, should strive to ensure that the law is developed and applied in a consistent and predictable manner, so that citizens may order their affairs with confidence as to their rights and duties. i believe this is the previous intention of doctrine of precedent, but just as you concerned, with the change of situation, people may be confused about if the case of precedent is reliable. it seems that it would be better if there is a codified law. but what i concern is even though some laws are written, it usually in the way that is not easy for ordinary people without law background to have a thorough understanding. after all the realistic situation is so complicate that the written law cant give clear guide to all the issues.",1,F,MANDARIN

"hi thomas e + thomas j,
thanks for bringing this example up thomas e - it's a really interesting case that highlights the gaps in our law, including the alrc recommendations!
i agree, it seems like the proposed alrc tort for serious invasions of privacy may not cover this situation, particularly the intrusion into seclusion/misuse of personal information element and the fact that there is some public interest in this issue. for example, it's at least somewhat in the public's interest to know about their relationship to see if our court system is facilitating romantic relationships that decrease the integrity of our court system, whether or not it actually does (i'm not saying it does, just merely that the public has an interest in this issue). 
thomas j, your suggestion of alrc research into social media privacy is definitely needed. a report on this, i think, should also have a section dedicated to teenagers/young persons and their specific privacy issues.
however, either way, any recommendations into privacy/social media privacy need to be very cautious on limiting traditional media coverage. i think it's in the public interest to have journalists report on issues of public interest and limiting this in fear of causing emotional distress could be detrimental for certain public issues. in this particular case, i don't think the public would've been any worse off not knowing about their relationship and it has an incredibly sad outcome that perhaps could've been avoided. however, for other cases that involve the proper administration of government and our overall legal system, i think it's reasonable for the media to cover this and to expect some hurt feelings along the way (the balance of this, however, is certainly up for debate).

"hi choirul! i think the point you made regarding the bribery of judges is very interesting. it definitely goes to show that in this specific case the legislative and executive powers have a say in how the judiciary functions and interpret the law. it is also interesting to note how the notion of power - through money and influence, can deter the courts from upholding the rule of law over the legislative and executive powers. 
i come from singapore (which applies the same branches of government as it is in australia) and there have been whispers within citizens regarding the way the court processes are doled out to children of individuals in legislative and executive powers, where these children (by association of their powerful parents) get off with a warning whereas a normal citizen would face the full extent of the law. these are just some of the things i've heard and it makes me question whether the judiciary is truly separate from the legislative and executive powers.",1,F,TAMIL
"hi chao, i agree with you that judicial independence is essential because it may bring the human rights as a fundamental value for all of people, particularly the rights of equality before the law. the equality before the law means that everyone, no matter who they are, should be treated by the courts equally, and the judges of the courts should independently give a good law consideration as well as good decision for the people, meaning that other institution, such as parliament and executive government, should not be involved or do some intervention in the process of making decision.
the judicial independence also takes an important role in the process of law enforcement because from this phase, subject of law will get new binding legal consequences. if the judges do not have the independence, while they have to find the truth of the case, they may be influenced by other parties where sometimes it could be state parties, for example the state of prosecutor in the criminal justice system. thus, judicial independence is able to guarantee people that the law will be enforced equally and truthfully based on the evidence in the litigation.",1,M,INDONESIAN

"hi everyone!
ryan here - i wasn't able to attend this lecture (and won't be able to attend the next few) as i'm serving self-isolation (having come from singapore recently), but hope to see you all soon!

that aside, after watching today's lecture and reading the letter here:https://lms.monash.edu/pluginfile.php/10206931/mod_page/content/3/ker046_fm.pdf, i decided to pen down some thoughts.

certainly, court proceedings of any nature come at major costs to all involved parties. these may include the substantial legal fees, psychological trauma, or the costs in the event of a loss.
one of the biggest costs not mentioned by the article is the rise of defensive medicine. doctors and hospitals are notorious for overcharging, a major recent example being mr azcue's case (which you can read about here:https://www.businessinsider.com.au/coronavirus-treatment-medical-bill-hospital-costs-2020-3?r=us&amp;ir=t).
defensive medicine is a form of overtreatment, where doctors prescribe medical processes (most commonly diagnostics or tests) which may not be in the best interests of the patient, but will protect them in the case of suit. by allowing people to sue medical proffessionals, the amount of public funds required for a no-fault insurance scheme are reduced. at the same time, public expenditure is increased as medical costs invariably go up due to defensive medicine. i find this circular situation pretty ironic.

on the opposite side, and to play a little bit of devil's advocate, while i don't disagree with the statistic that most medical lawsuits are towards perfectly competent doctors, i don't think that a no-fault compensation system is appropriate here. the article lists the compensation systems of highways and workplaces as successful examples. however, accidents in both usually happen as a result of unfortunate circumstances. compare this to a hospital, where the patient is under supervision by a doctor, who holds most of the discretion in supplying treatments or drugs to a patient. i think it is unfair to draw parallels between a relatively controlled environment where one person makes most of the decisions to a dynamic environment like roads or workplaces.


let me know your thoughts, and stay safe :)

sincerely,
ryan foo

"hi michael. when reading your post, it reminded me of what ms. jones said in her testimony; i suggest that the royal commission should consider implementing standardised first response communication for peripheral support people. the royal commission did attempt to address this issue by the recommendation of specialist family violence courts (sfvc).
although the sfvc themselves are a legal process, the reforms suggested by the royal commission are relevant to this discussion as they are indicative of a holistic approach to justice. one of the fundamental aspects of the sfvc is that there is a conscious effort that all court staff, including lawyers, judges and registrars complete training in family violence, as well as having holistic, wrap around services present at the courts to support both survivors and perpetrators.
one of the main holistic services that would be present at the court are specialized family violence services. there has been a large discussion related to these specialized services, however there has been little said related to these services from a cultural perspective. it is not noted what culture ms. jones and her son are, however if they were from a culturally and linguistically diverse (cald) or indigenous background, there should have been culturally appropriate services, in place. for example, if ms. jones and/or her son were from a cald background, she would have been referred to a specialized family violence service such as intouch that would also provide that cultural understanding and frameworks, as well as ensuring appropriately trained interpreters are used, as outlined in recommendation 158 of the royal commission.",1,F,ENGLISH

here is a new answer
would a rp perceive sarahs conduct as a willingness to contract on certain disclosed terms (australian woollen mills)?
a rp would perceive sarah's question to her neighbour 'are you interested in buying... for $200?' as question that invites an offer from her neighbour (e.g yes i'd be interested in buying the table $200).
even if this phrase was perceived as colloquialism, it can still be argued that because sarah's conduct is merely verbal and not written, it is 'mere puff' that lacks 'sincerity' (carbolic). thus it is not an offer.",1,M,ENGLISH
"hello, everyone! my name is letitia, welcome to discuss each other.
1	according to paragraph 47 and 49, the first inappropriate thing is that intervention order did not cover ms jones son. as ms jones referred that her ex-husband had begun to direct violence at her son, even her son become anxiety around her ex-husband, which seriously did harm to her sons physical and mental safety. in fact, the two aims of justice system responding to family violence is to ensure victim safety and hold the perpetrator accountable for the violence. however, the magistrate did not take actions to protect the safety of ms jones son.
2	according to paragraph 45 and 46, the second thing is that the cost of private barrister is too high. as ms jones referred in paragraph 43, she was ineligible for legal aid because she had some savings in the bank. when she had spent over $50,000 and did not have enough money for final contested hearing, victoria legal aid informed that they did not fund any final trials. in other words, normal people who do not have enough money can be hard to afford to deal with the relevant issue of family violence. we should relive the financial burden of victims of family violence. 
3	the magistrate did not concentrate on protecting victims safety. as the original intervention order has covered the weapons restriction, it means ms jones ex-husband indeed has been a threat to the safety of her and her son. when came to the topic of weapons restriction, the magistrate was supposed to take actions to guarantee victims safety. according to paragraph 49, the magistrate thought the weapons restriction did not cover ownership of an unregistered firearm. he refused to make her ex-husband hand in the gun, meaning he did not stand with the victims. 
4	the magistrate should not treat ms jones in a belittling way. according to paragraph 50 and 51, the magistrate showed sympathy to her ex-husband, but expressed worse attitudes to her. as referred in paragraph 10, she contacted the magistrates court for advice but felt uncomfortable. in fact, victims of family violence were ashamed to tell others their experience, and retelling the experience would do harm to the victims. thus, i suggest employees served people who experienced family violence should be nicer and politer when listening and inquiring.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"

"the case of anna jones highlights the inadequate awareness of the dangers faced by women and children through informal dispute resolution environments, and particularly those who have experienced family violence. these disadvantages include the inability to reach a safe agreement as women may be coerced into agreement, and mediators oftentimes being unable to remain neutral when considering the issue of access. in relation to the first point, evidence suggests that women not only tend to experience psychological, however also economic vulnerability. as emphasised in discussion papers such as bruce chapman and john beggs', the foregone earnings from child-rearing in australia, women tend to experience higher levels of poverty than men post-separation, which can negatively impact their power of negotiation in mediation. anna is the perfect example of this, as she was financially unable to litigate, and thereby forced to utilise the avenue of mediation. for countless women like anna, their inability to fund fully contested trials means that they must come to an agreement through fdr methods, despite its appropriateness. furthermore, financial support ought to be provided to women, especially mothers fleeing violent relationships at home. this support should come in the form of packages, or grants, or even early access to superannuation, whether it be to fund litigation or pay rent for their new homes. secondly, considering the unprofessional nature of the mediator in prioritising the efficiency of the mediation over protecting anna and her son, a reform is necessary to require mediators to encourage and emphasise the significance of reaching an agreement that is in the best interests of the child. it may therefore be necessary to further educate such facilitators on the issue of family violence, as it is a real possibility that they will bring their own perspectives to the professional environment. for example, a mediator may share the same viewpoint as the judge in annas situation (i.e. federal circuit court), that is the fathers right to maintain contact with his son (http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/qutlawjjl/2005/2.html). the negative consequence of this is that womens stories are unable to be shared to establish a background of family violence, thus unfairly limiting their negotiating power to confidently protect not only their interests, however also that of their childrens. if the said mediator is biased and directs the negotiation away from issues of family violence to encouraging equally shared parenting rights, women will continue to experience severe disadvantages throughout these informal processes.",1,F,ASSYRIAN NEO-ARAMAIC

"a:
id like to add to your discussion of jeffries' suggestion that allegations of violence are dismissed by the court, particularly in reference to shared parenting. merry (2003, 353) argues that victims of family violence in legal processes need to perform a self that conform[s] to the laws definition of rational and autonomous reactions to violence, demonstrating that they are entitled to help.
ms jones asked her barrister to pursue an argument for her ex-husband to have no-contact with his son, due to her concerns for her son's safety. the barristers warning that the court may, in response to the request, grant majority custody to the father, presents the negative, dismissive response to the 'irrational' victims behaviour. the 'rational' mother is perceived by the courts to be someonewho supports shared custody.

b:
your discussion of situational violence in the report writing process reminds me of the framing of allegations as a series of isolated incidents, as often happens in cases of family violence (hunter, 2008, 41). you mention hart's analysis that judgments fail to address exposure to family violence and impact on the child. it is easy to see how this is possible when family violence is minimised to isolated incidents, as this fails to establish a pattern of behaviour.
the minimised risk, combined with the preference towards rational reactions to family violence, skews the court system away from victims/survivors undermining the potential for the process to achieve autonomy from the abuser and validation (merry, 2003).",1,F,ENGLISH

"i agree with many of the points that samantha has made here. when discussing family violence, it is evident that perpetrators will display violent tendencies. 
regardless if these characteristics are found in the victim as well or not, 
the professional conducting the pre-mediation interview should have considered these potential characteristics of the perpetrator before the interview, 
and thus would have recognised the behaviour in the interview. 

this would most likely have decided that a mediation session for mr and ms jones would be deemed inappropriate. 
in this instance, there is a high chance that the mediation session continued regardless, due to the other processes, 
such as litigation, not proceeding due to a lack of finances. this could have been in an effort to help mr. and ms. jones reach an outcome. 
while this could be seen as advantageous to mr. and ms jones, it is important to acknowledge that despite mediation being less of a financial burden, it should not be seen as a less viable option in comparison to other processes. if a process is seen as inappropriate, especially when it could impact the health and safety of an individual, the process should not be followed through.",1,M,ENGLISH

"1. what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law? under s.5(1) of the sentencing act 1991 (vic), there are 5 main aims of sanctions, which is to punish the offender, protect the wider community, rehabilitate the offender, denunciate them and specific as well as general deterrence, to discourage the offenders and the public from committing similar offences. 

stephen j refers to protecting the community by prohibiting infliction that is injurious to the public and the person injured.  
the wolfenden report emphasises the need to preserve public order and decency as well as protect the public from whatever may be offensive or injurious while also needing to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others, particularly those who are especially vulnerable because they are young, weak in body or mind, inexperienced, or in a state of special, physical, official or economic dependence. 

hence, the wolfenden report reiterates the importance of protecting not just the community but the vulnerable from potential sources of harm through the implementation of law and punishing those who break it. 

2. what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from? hawkins j mentions that in order to maintain individual rights, ones decision to compromise will not be able to compromise the public interest. this emphasises that criminal law holds the main principle of protecting the wider community from harm as a persons decision to stray away from what is considered acceptable should not overcome the views and values of the majority of the public. hence, law is mainly based on societal morals such as when lord templeman refers to the practice of s&amp;m as a cult of violence and cruelty [that] is uncivilised. 

3. should crimes vary between jurisdictions? crimes should vary between jurisdictions as each court hears cases based on their complexity and severity. thus, with each court having a specific jurisdiction within the court hierarchy, this allows judicial officials to develop expertise and familiarity of the law with the cases they hear. this allows cases to be decided faster where judicial officers are more than familiar with the area of law discussed in the case, as well as provide fairer outcomes where this reinforces the notion of stare decisis, where like cases are heard and decided in a like manner. having specific jurisdiction and expertise in an area of law allows judges to provide fairer and more consistent decisions as they have dealt with a wide range of similar cases. 

4. should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided? crimes should change with the times as the attitude of the public towards homosexual practices changed in the second half of [the] century. hence, change(s) in public attitudes should lead to a change in the law. otherwise, if the law does not reflect the majority of the views of the society, it will more likely not be enforced and followed by them as the behaviour and law set out are not accepted by the majority of the public. 

parliament recognised and accepted the practice of homosexuality by enacting s.1 of the sexual offences act 1967, where sexual activities conducted in private between not more than two consenting adults of the same sex or different sexes are no lawful. however, they have retained criminal sanctions against the practice, dissemination and encouragement of homosexual activities.",1,M,VIETNAMESE

workshop tasks

workshop 1:

answer the following questions, referring to r vbrown [1994] 1 ac 212 and noting the differences between the majority and minority views of the judges/lords in that case:

what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?

to punish, deter, protect, rehabilitate &amp; denunciate. in relation to r v brown, the majority found that the private acts conducted between these homosexual males, despite consent, is worthy of conviction. one of the aims of sentencing is to protect the community from an offender and sometimes an offender from themselves. in lord templemans judgment, he outlines that it is an offence for a person to abuse his own body and mind by taking drugs, and although the appellants did not conduct any conduct that mutilated each others bodied, they inflicted bodily harm for sexual pleasure without any complete understanding of the harm they are doing labelling such violence of sadomasochist as unpredictably dangerous. this is perhaps even more evident when lord templeman highlights how society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. furthermore, by making actions of sadomasochists unlawful punishment, deterrence and denunciation are naturally demonstrated. the fact they can be convicted and sentenced to jail demonstrates their punishment and affirms that society disapproves of their behaviour albeit not all. and the existence of a punishment will deter others from further offending.

what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?

the values behind criminal law are morality, paternalism and prevention of harm. in the case of r v brown we see these values all being weighed upon across the different judgments. in lord templemans judgment he highlights how society is bound to protect itself against a cult of violence and irrespective of the victim's consent in this case their actions were of a seriously harmful nature. this reflects the value of paternalism and the principle hla hart once established. harming others is something we may still seek to prevent by the use of criminal law, even when the victims consent to or assist in the acts which are harmful to them. however, when dealing with new crimes there is always a question of morality. criminal law is seen as vindicating the key moral values of society. however, the division between laws and morals is not always clear cut as seen in lord mustills judgment.

i do not advocate the decriminalization of conduct which has hitherto been a crime; nor do i rebut a submission that a new crime be created, penalizing this conduct

lord mustill found himself feeling the need to protect individuals' private acts and that the house is not always invited to take action and get involved in the private lives of others. however, as mentioned previously he does not necessarily agree with the appellants actions.

should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

crimes do vary across jurisdictions for various reasons. one of the main reasons is as different values stem from different religions and cultures, and therefore laws must be moulded to fit those expectations.

an example of the difference in circumstances may be observed in the current covid-19 crisis. countries which are renowned for receiving a relatively high number of immigrants, such as australia or italy will need to enforce more strict legislation governing peoples activities, such as isolation in comparison to other countries. this means that an act that may constitute a crime in australia may not do so in other countries.

another reason for a difference in what may be known as a crime in different jurisdictions would be the difference in societal, cultural and religious values. different countries will have a different culture and hence a different view on what should constitute a legal wrong. a good example of this would be sharia law. which is derived from islamic traditions and values.

one reason that crimes should not vary is to promote consistency within the law. the basic principle would be that regardless of where a person may be at a certain given time, they can be comfortable in what would and what would not constitute a legal wrong, otherwise known as a crime. in this way people would be able to better identify with the law as there would only be one set of rules that outline what is okay and what isnt, hence it would be easier to follow.

should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?

yes crimes should change with the times. one of the purposes of the law is to reflect community values, if they dont the law will not be followed and the governing body will be overthrown by the people. in r v brown, lord templeman references the wolfenden report 1967 which legalised homosexual activities and outlined the specific homosexual offences. prior to this, fornication between two men was illegal. however the law changed, today most countries have even legalised gay marriage. it is only natural that the law and therefore the crimes should change with the times as the world and society is ever evolving. when law is made, it is made to deal with the current society and its foreseeable future. it is impossible to think of every scenario when making a law, especially for 100 years in the future where there is no question as to what the world will be like. take the example of technology and hackers, the law had to be updated to protect individuals privacy and to create new crimes for online hackers.

with regards to how this should all be decided and who will have the power to change the law the natural answer is to say parliament. parliament is chosen by the people to represent the people, we live in a democracy. therefore, it is only natural that the parliament has the ability to change or update the law to accommodate for society's changing views.

"uda manslaughter
ellen may be liable for committing unlawful and dangerous act (uda) manslaughter.

actus reus
voluntary act
on the facts, it is clear that ellen stabbed ron out of free will. her action is in response to ron threatening hugo, and since she stabbed ron in multiple places (his stomach, wrist and chest), it is evident that the act was voluntary and willed by her conscious mind (ugle).

causation
although ron technically died due to the bacteria in his bowel, ron would not have had this bacteria from his ruptured bowel had it not been for ellen stabbing him, and a chain of causation may be found to apply (blaue). however, on the facts it appears as though there may have been negligent medical care provided by his doctors, as his death is attributed to a failure to diagnose this complication in a timely manner. thus, the defence would seek to have the court apply r v jordan in this case (where negligent medical care can be an intervening act). ultimately, the court is likely to consider ellens stab wounds the substantial and operating cause of rons death (hallett).

death of a human being
this is clearly made out on the facts, as ron died.

unlawful and dangerous act
if rons death is found to be caused by ellens stab wounds, then the death would be the result of ellen carrying out an unlawful and dangerous act. by stabbing ron multiple times, ellen could be found to be carrying out an offence under either s.15a of the crimes act (causing serious injury in circumstances of gross violence) or s.16 (causing serious injury intentionally), both of which are unlawful and dangerous. applying test from wilson, a reasonable person in ellens position would have realised that stabbing ron multiple times would expose him to an appreciable risk of serious injury.

mens rea
intention
on the facts, ellen would have most likely understood the imminent harm posed to ron due to her stabbing him, and thus could be found to have the requisite intention (westaway). it is clear that ellens offence is in an effort to protect her son hugo, as she yells at ron dont touch him immediately before she stabs him. furthermore, on the facts it does not appear that ellen had the intention to murder ron, as her exclamation indicates she attacked him merely to get him to let go of hugo.

defence
the defence would argue that the chain of causation cannot be made out, since ron died from a bacterial infection (see above; causation)

prosecution
the prosecution would argue that all the requisite mens rea and actus reus elements are satisfied. they would address the issue of causation by stating that ron would not have been put in a position to catch a bacterial infection were it not for ellen stabbing him (see above; causation)

conclusion
it is likely that causation will be made out, and that ellen will be liable for uda manslaughter. on the contentious point of causation, the prosecution will invoke r v blaue and the defence will invoke r v jordan. both are from english courts of appeal, and thus have equal value as persuasive precedents, however on the facts blaue would be found as more relevant.



questions
could we argue causation either way (made out or not made out) as long as we back it up with relevant cases?

"hi jackie thanks again for your reply. in the situation you mentioned above, where a client was assaulted at a train station and sustained broken ribs and punches to his abdomen, it is likely that he would be eligible for a claim of financial assistance. this client will be classified as a primary victim. the crime committed against them would also satisfy the definition of being an ""act of violence"" as the client suffered an injury (this is also assuming that the crime occurred in victoria). in making a claim, there is a number of supporting documents that a person bringing a claim should provide, if available. these are as follows:counselling expenses
medical expenses

"uda manslaughter

ar
there are several elements one needs to satisfy for the actus reus of killing someone. firstly the act needs to be voluntary. ellens stabbing was voluntary as it was a freely willed act (ugle) while she was in control of her actions. secondly, ellen needs to have brought about rons death. the stabbing was the substantial and operating cause of rons death(hallett) as the stabbing caused the infection to come about, causation can be made out. per the definition in r v hutty ron is a reasonable creature and per the human tissue act 1982, ron has died as he had an irreversible cessation of all blood.

for uda manslaughter to be established, the killing has to be done in the course of doing an unlawful and dangerous act. the stabbing was an act subject to criminal punishment (via common law assault), which constitutes an unlawful act. the application of force through a weapon (knife) per the definition of assault in fagan is made out proving it to be an unlawful act.

the elements of the unlawful act also have to be made out, for actus reus, there was an unlawful application of force through stabbing ron through the chest, arm and stomach. although this was done through a weapon it does not matter per the principle in fagan. ellen also satisfies the mr as ellen intended to cause injury to ron.

lastly the act has to be dangerous defined as likely to injure someone in r v wilson. ellens decision to lunge at ron with a knife could be considered a dangerous act as it was likely to injure ron.

mr
ellen intended to commit the uda. thus, uda manslaughter may be only need mr for the unlawful act, as shown above.

defense- consent- in giving ellen the knife and compelling her to use it, come on ,use it, ron may have implied consent. however, this is quite a weak defense as in r v brown, the victim cannot consent to grievous bodily nature of unpredictably dangerous nature as would be resulted by the knife.


voluntary manslaughter

ar

ellens stabbing of ron with the knife was a free willed, voluntary act. the stabbing causes damage to the bodily organs and therefore is a substantial and operating cause of the infection that proceeds the medical treatment and the ultimate death. ellens actions have caused rons death as per the definition of death in the human tissue act 1982,  an irreversible cessation of all blood. ellens actions is an operating and substantial cause of death (hallett) in the common law as well. her actions are voluntary. the victim of her killing is a reasonable creature in being- ron in human as per the definition in r v hutty.

however ellens actions may have a lawful excuse. (see below)

defences
the defence could raise the question of whether the medical treatment sufficed to completely overwhelm the first cause of death- ellens stab. similarly, in r v evans and gardiner, the defendants stabbed v, causing an injury which was healed. however, an uncommon complication following the medical procedure caused the death of the deceased- similar to the present case. here, it was decided the doctors should have diagnosed the condtion and the defendants were not found guilty of murder, but rather of manslaughter. the defence in the present case may raise a similar defence. however, on the contrary in r v smith-, following a stab, had v been given a blood transfusion, he would have had a 75% chance of recovery.similar to the present case, here,a medical failure to diagnose the infection timely, is the direct cause of death. however in r v smith, the conviction was upheld.
negligent medical treatment can break the chain of causation, novus actus interveniens, when the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history. in this case the second cause is not overwhelming as ron -holding the knife up is an intentional act  which is enough to constitute violence was in surgery for his stab wound when the infection occurred.

ellen is acting in self defence per 322k (self defence) and 322m (family violence)
322k - the defence of self-defence applies in circumstances where ds conduct was carried out for the purpose(s) of: defending themselves / another person from unlawful violence 322m - without limiting the evidence that may be adduced, in circumstances where self-defence in the context of family violence is in issue, evidence of family violence may be relevant in determining whether
a person has carried out conduct while believing it to be necessary in self-defence;


mr

intention
it can be argued by the prosecution that ellen has satisfied the mens rea element of intention to cause death or grievous bodily harm (malice aforethought). ellen may have acted with an intention to cause grievous bodily harm, however it is likely that it was not her intention to kill ron. this lack of intention can be seen in her preventative measures to avoid his death including attempting to stop the bleeding and calling the ambulance could infer that she did not intend to cause his death.
on the other hand the prosecution could argue that her giving the wrong address is also indicative of her intention to kill ron as she did not want the ambulance to be able to save him, however this would most likely not succeed as it states that she was in a state of panic whilst calling the ambulance which resulted in this mistake.
the prosecution could also argue that ellen did have the intention to kill ron. meyers states that intention is subjective but can be inferred from the circumstances. the fact that she stabbed him 3 separate times in the wrist, chest and stomach could be enough to infer her intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm. further she has been constantly abused, taunted and even raped by ron throughout their marriage. while intention is commonly equated with the desire to bring about a particular result, a person may intend a particular result without actually desiring it. this can be seen in the case of r v saunders and archer (1577) where saunders intended to kill his wife, however did not desire this. this could be similar in this case, as it is possible that ellen intended to kill ron, however did not desire his death as shown by her attempting to stop the bleeding and her distraught manner.

"workshop 3:

read fagan v metropolitan police commissioner [1969] 1 qb 439.
    what was the charge?
assault of a police officer
    is this offence common law or statutory?
statutory offence under s51 police act [1964]
    which elements relate to actus reus and mens rea?
ar = guilty act

first mounting of the foot was ar and continued until the wheel was removed.


omitting to remove wheel.

mr = guilty mind

did not exist prior to mounting wheel on foot.


arose once wheel mounted foot and the intention was formed flowing from the continuing act - swearing at the police officer indicates requisite awareness/intent of ar.

imagine fagans car only stayed on the police officers foot for seven seconds. however, the foot of the officer was badly cut and broken. the officer went to hospital immediately but received poor medical treatment. a year later his foot had to be amputated.

1.   consider ss. 16, 17 and 24 of the crimes act, and discuss which offence(s) fagan would most likely be charged with and found guilty of, if this happened in melbourne in 2020.
16 = intentionally 17= recklessly 24=negligently (all assault)

reckless: aware of being on the foot - continued despite acknowledgement of wrongfulness.


the term recklessness is used to denote a lesser state of mind than intent.


may involve a turning of the mind (ignorance) to the possibility or probability of the outcome and proceeding anyway

2.   what arguments might fagan raise in his defence?
causation link was broken by the poor treatment he received in hospital therefore, his actions did not directly cause the amputation of the foot.
too much time has elapsed.
he could argue that the action was accidental. - potentially an involuntary action.
concurrence of ar and mr was not present.

driving onto ar but mr


omitting to move mr present but no ar because he was not committing an act. (bridge j states that the omission does not constitute an act - this could be persuasive)

3.   what if the officers foot healed completely, but he was so traumatised by the event that he could never work again? discuss which offence(s) fagan would most likely be charged with and found guilty of, if this happened in melbourne in 2020.
s18 - causing injury intentionally or recklessly - in this case injury means physical injury or harm to mental health.

would require a 6 month sentence of imprisonment to be imposed because it is against an on duty custodial officer.

topic 1

refer to brown [1994] 1 ac 212 and note the differences between the majority and minority views when discussing the following:

what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?


just punishment (retribution)


denunciation and moral reprobation


deterrence (specific and general)


rehabilitation and reform


incapacitation and community protection


majority: protection of the community, deterrence, denunciation, moral reprobation.
minority: protection of the community (yet conduct regarding questions of private morality doesnt require punishment).

what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?

the prevention of harm

bypunishing those who participate in actions that can cause harm, the legal system can eliminate or reduce the frequency of these harmful actions happening later on (both by the offender and others who may be thinking of committing that offence.)


based on the harm principle - the idea that restrictions on individual liberty must be curtailed and justifiable only in order to prevent harm to others


idea that if there is no harm, there should be no criminalisation


issues: some issues that occur with the harm principle are uncertainty about what causes harm to others : what behaviour can be seen as harmful and how can you assess that harm has been caused to those who can not describe it (young children, severely disabled people?) (walter and williams criminal law text and cases 13ed, 1.11)


issues: what is counted as harm is heavily influenced by moral views e.g. homosexual conduct made the activity harmful in the eyes of the law but in r v wilson (1997) similar activity between a husband and wife was considered consenual activity


r v brown

the group were actively engaging in conduct that was dangerous and degrading to the body and mind- lord templeman


it was held that even though the sado-masochistic activities were consensual and on private premises, they constituted unlawful assaults as actual bodily injury was inflicted


lords recognised a vast difference between the consensual infliction of bodily harm pursued in the course of lawful activities such as boxing or tattooing, and the infliction of violence for sexual purposes. this notion is justified by lord templeman who explains that the harm caused in these circumstances is inflicted for the indulgence of cruelty


society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence - lord templeman


the vindication of moral values

for conduct to warrant classification as criminal it must involve a moral wrongdoing that amounts to an attack on a communitys core moral values


criminalisation may play a normative role in shaping public opinion, so where conduct is criminalised it may influence public attitudes to that conduct. decriminalization may also influence community values and political responses in the law.


issues: the very illegality of an activity can change the perception of its underlying moral quality


issues: this debate assumes that morality is a prior state of affairs to which the law responses, in reality morality changes according to time and place


r v brown:

should sadomasochistic consensual sex should be regarded as morally wrong?


in the point of view of lord templeman pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing as cruelty is uncivilised thus justifying his classification of this behaviour as morally unjust.


lord devlin stated immorality then, for the purpose of the law, is what every right-minded person is presumed to consider to be immoral


however, lord mustill held an opposing view as to whether behaviour regarded as morally wrong conducted in private should be classified as crime. he expresses that these are questions of private morality, the standards by which they fall to be judged are not those of the criminal law; and of these standards are to be upheld the individual must enforce them upon himself according to his own moral standards


expression of public concern

based on the idea that we need to protect people against themselves, even if there is no moral dimension and no harm to others. this involves people acting in their own interests and the interests of society. e.g. traffic offenses, use of drugs.


crime is considered a public wrong


criminalisation serves as an expression of legitimate public concerns by taking relevant community values and re-affirming them in a legal form


however, it can be difficult to differentiate in what actions can be a cause of public concern. this is also because people can have different views on what is of interest to the public.


due to changes in social dynamics, some actions, such as marital rape and revenge pron, being criminalised. some previously criminal offences, like sex between homosexuals, were also decriminalised.


hla hart argues that an act being moral does not mean it should not be prevented.


the likings and dislikings of society...are thus the main thing which has determined the rules laid down - john stuart mill


r v brown:

the two mens actions presented a clear risk of injury or infection to themselves.


the state should interfere with the rights of an individual to live his or her life as he or she may choose no more than is necessary to ensure a balance between the special interests of the individual and the general interests of the individuals who together comprise the populace at large - lord mustill


should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

a sense of commonality and consistency must be present within the law, therefore no matter the jurisdiction of a court, the determination of what constitutes a crime should remain consistent. however crimes must also reflect the values and attitudes of the society, and these attitudes may vary from place to place, which inherently encompass different jurisdictions.

additionally, there are different theories in how to define crime which inevitably will change how different jurisdictions choose what is a crime and what isnt. for example, a proceduralist definition of crime is conduct which can be subjected to a criminal process. in this sense, it is not the nature of the prohibited conduct that distinguishes prohibitions on that conduct from other legal prohibitions, rather it is criminal procedure that is crucial to defining what crime is. in this sense, civil remedies such as damages and injunctions are not classified as criminal punishment. the substantive conception of crime defines crimes in terms of what they are, without reference to the legal process that is applied to them. crimes are instead referred to public wrongs which are of concern to the wider community.

crimes should remain consistent between jurisdictions in instances in which the facts of the cases are similar. if there is bias and inconsistency between classifications of crime, this may undermine the values of fairness and impartiality that constitute the foundations of the criminal law system. this notion is explored in the case of r v wilson (1996), in which a husband branded his wife's buttocks. the court upheld that consent can be a valid defence and thus no crime took place. however similar actions in r v brown (1994) found that violence for sexual pleasure between homosexuals was a criminal offence. this shows the inconsistency in what constitutes a crime between jurisdictions.

inconsistency between judgements may incur public scrutiny. in this instance the distinction between the homosexual group of men behaving in sadomasachisic behaviours in comparison to a hetrosexual couple engaging in simalar conduct could be interpreted as demonstarting bias attidudes towards homosexual people.

however, sometimes crimes do need to be different in different jurisdictions if that society or subgroup is facing specific issues that are different from other jurisdictions. in some cases, some laws need to be enforced on a stricter level as well to combat problems that are of public interest.

should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?

the definition of crime is closely associated with the morals and values of wider society. therefore, as public morals develop and change over time, the definition of crime will change too. for example, previously what was considered a public wrong was far removed from any acts done in private. for example, historitclaly, a man could not be proscuted for raping his wife in the matrimonial home, as this was done in private and not considered a public wrong. a shift in the public/private divide resulted in the criminalisation of previously lawful conduct of aritial immunity in rape. this came to be seen as morally wrong and something of concern to the public.

additionally, crimes need to reflect the present state and conditions of society. for example, in this period of a global pandemic, laws have been introduced and crimes have been extended to acts that undermine the safety of the community. if crimes shouldnt change with the times, we would not have crimes and laws that are imperative in today's climate including speeding fines, cyberbullying and laws surrounding the internet.

in order to determine whether a crime should be changed, there should be an inquiry as to whether the crime truly assimilates to the 3 values of criminal law. a decision should be made as to whether the conduct is still regarded as causing harm, morally unjust, and in place to protect the broader public interest. homosexual relations were once regarded as crime, however as attitudes developed through time, the question of the immorality of this act became highly contested. it was evident that homosexual conduct did not cause any harm, and their actions were no longer regarded as immoral by the majority thus no longer conforming to all three principles of criminal law.

however, when decriminalising an act, it is important to determine that all, or at least a large majority of the public do support this change. this can become an issue when a certain viewpoint gains a significant amount of attention in the media and people are more vocal in their support of it. this can serve to silence the opinions of those who are against this viewpoint , even those people may be in the majority. thus, it is important to give equal value to all opinions about a particular act, as this can aid people to confidently express their opinion without fear regardless of their view about a particular issue.

r v brown:
parliaments main responsibility is to make law and is designed to do so in a manner which reflects the values of the people. therefore, parliament should be the ones to introduce a majority of laws when the need arises. lord slynn stated it is a matter of policy for the legislature to decide...if society takes the view that this kind of behaviour is either so extensive or so understiable...then it is for the legislature to decide.

lord mustill contends that the task of balancing risk against the interests of individual freedom is meant for the parliament, not the courts. page 542 if you want to read :)

"hello everyone, i hope that everyone is doing well. i thought i could share some thoughts on the topic this week. i thought i would start with a general discussion.
what are everyones thoughts on this tort of statutory duty? do you believe that this tort is too confusing and contradictory, or is it meaningful to have it apart of our law? how could we resolve any ambiguities?why doesn't this tort have the prominence that it should?
general thoughts
my thoughts on this is that the particular framework implemented for bsd is reasonable. the elements of the tort are indeed quite useful in assessing if there is a cause of action available to a plaintiff. perhaps an additional benefit is that the tort provides private individuals with power, assome causes of action are only actionable by regulatory bodies.
however, i can understand why many critics desire for this tort to be abolished. the tort commonly presents inconsistency and a lack of a coherent basis, owing to the diversification of judicial interpretations and inconsistent policy outcomes. the law becomes unpredictable as it is difficult to forecast how the courts will deal with a particular statute in a certain set of circumstances.to add to this, it appears that more often than not, these claims for statutory duties tend to fail as a basis of civil action. to me, this also begs the question of why must we keep this tort if it is so confusing, and further, if we already have civil claims based on common law actions.
defences?
the defences for bsd is arguably quite a difficult topic. which defences could be plausibly available to such a breach?
additionally, it is questionable whether contributory negligence defences can apply. first, the statutory tort is a duty to someone and it is arguable that the law is not concerned with the actions of the other person, potentially explaining why cn may not be available. secondly, unlike some other jurisdictions (e.g. usa, canada), negligence and statutory breach of duty are not one and the same action.
further, if the fault is attributable to the plaintiff, which has put the defendant in the position to breach their statutory duty, then this tort prescribes that the plaintiff would be excluded from the limited class, and hence barred from a cause of action for the breach of duty (from millington; andar). this applies to fault that is solely created by the plaintiff, and my question is, what kind of defences are available to a defendant if they contributed to a small extent, but not majorly?
what are your thoughts and questions regarding this tort? i would love to hear other opinions as i have never really considered this tort before prior to this week.

what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?

central to lord templemans analysis of the law and thus, his reasoning in his election to dismiss the appeal is the notion that the public ought to be protected from the cruelty and evil of sado-masochism. his idea that, inflicting pain upon another person even in private, is a scourge against society is seen most when he notes society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. thus, his legal reasoning centres around the idea not so much as to punish the offenders, nor the idea that a prison sentence will somehow rehabilitate the offenders, but rather that these acts are injurious to society as a whole and as such, ought to be stamped out. he especially is worried for the victim, a boy introduced to the sado-masochistic sexual practices of the accused at aged 15, and argues that other, young, impressionable youths will be corrupted if the appeal were to be upheld. the idea of a cult of violence is also indicative of an idea of the protection of society; another key aim in the application of judicial punishments, particularly those involving incarceration.
in contrast to this, lord mustill. in his dissenting opinion, found that there was no need for a crime to be established in these circumstances as what occurs within the privacy of ones home is of no business to the criminal code. in this way, he rebuts the argument of lord templeman, in that the criminal code should only interfere in the lives of individuals so much as to ensure a proper balance between the special interests of the individual and the general interests of the individuals who together comprise the populace at large. stemming from this, lord mustill found no reason as to rehabilitate these individuals, as he abstained from any moral argument surrounding their practices, as it was not his job, but rather, was that of parliament.

what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?

the values behind the criminal law can be categorised into two contentions: morality and prevention of harm.
a moralistic view of criminal law contends that it is the place of the criminal law to bind society's views and values to create a cohesive community. it believes in interfering in a non-harmful act with the purpose to cement said social cohesion. for example, it would have been under a moralistic argument that one would state it was the criminal laws place to prevent gay marriage, as revealed in the wolfenden report. lord devlin advocated for this stating that there are no theoretical limits to the power of the state to legislate against treason and sedition, and likewise i think there can be no theoretical limits to legislation against immorality.
the prevention of harm is the second rationale of criminal law. this hartalistic view of the criminal law contends that it is beyond the criminal laws reach to dictate the acts of a person who acts in private, so long as it does not result in harm. john stewart mill stated that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent the harm of others. this contention of the law promotes libertarianism in the belief that unless an act causes harm, it should not be criminalised. this rationale of the law was contended by hla hart in stating that  harming others is something we may seek to prevent by use of the criminal law, even when the victims consent to or assist in the acts which are harmful to them.

should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

when discussing jurisdictions in australia, you must look at the differences between the federal and state governments, and the states themselves. the crimes act (1914) was one of the first compilations of criminal law in federalised australia, dealing with the most serious offences against the commonwealth and forming the basis of federal offences. however, under s.51 of the australian constitution, criminal law is not an express power of the federal government, and thus legislation largely falls to the individual states. the delegation of legislation and application of criminal law is more efficient at a state level than a federal level, as it can be argued that a varying criminal code across states would accommodate and reflect the differing values and interests of the populace.
undoubtedly, crimes are enforced to regulate and prohibit certain behaviours which may be considered to disrupt the peace and good order of society. the maintenance of social cohesion is dependent on criminalising certain conduct, which justice stephen concluded, that in its infliction is injurious to the public as well as to the person injured. thus, in the consideration of protecting public interest it is essential that crimes reflect what the jurisdiction generally considers to be injurious and the moral values of the society in which it serves. it would be ineffective to regulate behaviour that poses no threat nor harm to the civilization which it governs. in r v brown, lord templeman asserts society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. thus, it can be inferred it is the responsibility of each jurisdiction to initiate the most effective safeguards to protect itself from not only cults of violence, but also from what is offensive, dangerous or harmful so that crimes vary in accordance with the practicalities of a specific jurisdiction.

4. should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?
crimes that are established according to the criminal law should absolutely change with the times, reflecting evolving socioeconomic, moral and political values among the populations that the criminal law is imposed on. lord devlin articulated this principle in his seminal work the enforcement of morals, where he argued that the criminal law must reflect the contemporaneous moral zeitgeist of society, because a violation of those moral principles is an offence against society as a whole. indeed, lord devlin goes so far as to posit that if criminal laws are not compatible with a civilizations ethical principles, the society will disintegrate. certainly, when expressing his judgement in the british case of r v brown in the house of lords, lord templeman echoed devlins sentiments, justifying the punishment of sado-masochistic individuals to defend society from an immoral cult of violence. indeed, templemans concern that not criminalising sado-masochism, which he described as an evil thing, would breed and glorify cruelty, indicates his belief that crimes need to reflect changing public morals to promote social cohesion.
undoubtedly, crimes must change with the times because if they did not, previous australian crimes such as homosexual activity and abortion would still be crimes in 2020. conversely, slavery, a crime according to artice 8 of the international covenant on civil and political rights, would be legal today. evidently, the consequence of such a scenario would result in a deterioration of public faith in the criminal law, encouraging vigilante justice and the evisceration of public order. even john stuart mill, whose libertarian philosophy is opposed to devlin moralistic one, argued in his work on liberty that criminal laws should change insofar as is necessary to protect individuals from harm. lord templeman reflects this prerogative when he points out that the sado-masochistic activity engaged in by the appellants could have resulted in aids or an hiv infection.
while lord devlin asserts that what constitutes a crime should be decided according to what every right minded person is presumed to consider to be immoral, it is not necessary to agree with this proposition to agree that crimes should change as time progresses. due to the nature of australias parliamentary system, criminal legislation like the crimes act 1958 (vic) are passed by parliaments according to what parliamentarians perceive as necessary for the times. in doing this, parliaments generally enjoy broad support, considering that australian parliaments are theoretically representative of the australian people. if they are not, australians are always entitled to vote to enact legislative change in the criminal law according to their moral values with every parliamentary election. despite the fact that lord mustill dissented in r v brown, he also supports this view that crimes must change with the times when he states that the question of how to balance individual freedom with moral concerns such as the risk that sado-masochism could pose to individuals and society is...for parliament. therefore, lord mustill consents that parliament should have the power to decide what is a crime and adjust those definitions with the passage of time.

"i agree with hannah and samanthas opinions regarding the unprofessionalism of the fdr practitioners and would like to elaborate on the necessity of compulsory screening. 
mediators are often incompetent at identifying risks of harm, they fail to recognise family violence in the majority of cases when victims have disclosed their experience of physical violence in the relationship. (ballard et al 2011, 256) although it is widely recognised that screening and risk assessment is imperative universal screening is not yet obligatory.

mandatory screening should be implemented to help identify family violence and risks of harm. relationships australia (south australia) has employed universal risk screening by using family doors framework. in the first 675 clients screened, high levels of past abuse or current risks were identified. the less conspicuous risks comprised of alcohol, drug risk, parenting stress and suicidal thoughts were also revealed. (lee and mcintosh 2019, 52) drug and alcohol misuse is often linked to family violence. therefore, the early identification of risks enables quick and effective intervention responses in order to maintain safety and wellbeing for the victims and children.

in light of the costs that will be incurred by compulsory screening and the significant levels of risk that will be mitigated, additional funding is vital for the implementation of universal screening.

"uda manslaughter
ellen may be liable for committing unlawful and dangerous act (uda) manslaughter if the prosecution can make out the following elements.

actus reus
voluntary act
on the facts, it is clear that ellen stabbed ron out of free will. her action is in response to ron threatening hugo, and since she stabbed ron in multiple places (his stomach, wrist and chest), it is evident that the act was voluntary and willed by her conscious mind (ugle).

causation
although ron technically died due to the bacteria in his bowel, ron would not have had this bacteria from his ruptured bowel had it not been for ellen stabbing him, and a chain of causation may be found to apply regardless (blaue). on the facts it appears as though there may have been negligent medical care provided by his doctors, as his death is attributed to a failure to diagnose this complication in a timely manner. the defence would argue that this is a sufficient intervening act to absolve ellen from having any liability and seek to have the court apply r v jordan in this case (where negligent medical care can be an intervening act). in r v jordan, the victim was given antibiotics after surgery on a stab wound and died due to an allergic reaction. however, in r v jordan, the medical care was considered palpably bad because the doctors knew of the victims allergies to the antibiotic in advance and administered it anyway. thus, we can distinguish the extent of the negligent medical care in this case when compared with r v jordan as the doctors did not completely disregard prior knowledge about the patients medical history. ultimately, the court is likely to consider ellens stab wounds the substantial and operating cause of rons death (hallett).

death of a human being
this is clearly made out on the facts, as ron died. this meets the requirements of death defined in s.41 of the human tissues act 1982.

unlawful and dangerous act
if rons death is found to be caused by ellens stab wounds, then the death would be the result of ellen carrying out an unlawful and dangerous act. by stabbing ron multiple times, ellen could be found to be carrying out an offence under either s.16 of the crimes act 1958 (causing serious injury intentionally), which is unlawful. it can also be considered dangerous if we apply the test from wilson v r, it is evident that a reasonable person in ellens position would have realised that stabbing ron multiple times would expose him to an appreciable risk of serious injury.

mens rea
intention
on the facts, ellen would have most likely understood the imminent harm posed to ron due to her stabbing him, and thus would be found to have the requisite intention (westaway). it is clear that ellens offence is in an effort to protect her son hugo, as she yells at ron dont touch him immediately before she stabs him. furthermore, on the facts it does not appear that ellen had the intention to murder ron, as her exclamation indicates she attacked him merely to get him to let go of hugo.

defence
the defence would argue that the chain of causation cannot be made out, since ron died from a bacterial infection (see above; causation)

prosecution
the prosecution would argue that all the requisite mens rea and actus reus elements are satisfied. they would address the issue of causation by stating that ron would not have been put in a position to catch a bacterial infection were it not for ellen stabbing him (see above; causation)

conclusion
it is likely that causation will be made out, and that ellen will be liable for uda manslaughter.

"actus reus:
e killed r: yes, e impaled r with a knife, in his stomach, wrist and chest
voluntariness: e lunged at r, stabbing him in the stomach. her act of lunging demonstrates that her actions were freely willed and was not impaired by automatism, reflex action or any other causes of involuntariness
causation: e stabbing r was a substantial and operating cause. there was an intervening act (bacteria from bowel leaked caused complications), however this is unlikely to be so overwhelming as to make the first act merely part of history- following r v evans and gardiner, the stab wound is still part of the cause, without the stab wound, r would not have died
mens rea
broad act: no intention, the knife was handed to her by r, who told her that using it is her only way out of this marriage. further provocation whereby r shouts come on, use it- it can be inferred from these facts that if we were to apply the broad act, there would not be intention because lack of action from es part. firstly, she did not pick up the knife, it was handed to her, upon being handed the knife she did not proceed to threaten r with it. she took further abuse whilst r stepped forward before rushing hugo. she then made 3 stab wounds in the stomach, wrist and chest 
narrow act: intention, whilst maybe not intending to cause death, by stabbing him 3 separate times on 3 separate parts of his body, it can be inferred that she at least intended to cause grievous bodily harm. this is further supported by her lunging at him, that is, he was not approaching her when she caused him grievous bodily harm
if we refer to the narrow act, it is clear the mens rea element of intention is met, whilst if we consider the broad construction from when she was given the knife, the intention is blurred and thus it may be argued that she did not intend to cause him grievous bodily harm

possible lawful defence?
self defence- acted in appropriate manner because of threat towards hugo? it can be inferred through rs actions that he was in a state of anger, he repeatedly berated e, shouting at her on numerous occasions. this is further supported when he hands e the knife and provokes her to use it on him. in this case, e could reasonably believe that r would have caused hugo grievous bodily harm when he rushes him. therefore, her act of stabbing him was in defence of hugo. considering the likely physical difference between r and e, her actions were proportionate to the threat created by r.
prosecutor arguments
use narrow act to prove intention
construct stabbing as three separate occurrences in a broken up span of time, after the first stab, r was completely helpless yet e continued to stab on two more occasions, demonstrating that intent was present
claim operation complication has no bearing on causation- follow r v evans and gardiner
defence arguments
use broad act to prove lack of intention
construct stabbing as one straight occurrence which happened quickly, whereby e only, after the third stab, realised that r was helpless, strengthening the argument that she had no intention to cause grievous bodily harm
use attempt to call ambulance as further proof of lack of intention
claim operation complication breaks causation link- follow r v jordan
tentative conclusion
e is unlikely to be criminally liable for murder in relation to rs death due to defence/partial defence
e may be found criminally liable for a lesser penalty such as uda manslaughter
",1,M,MANDARIN
"hi everyone, when reading the texts for this week, i noticed a prominent trend with regard to how state courts discuss thewilkinsonprinciple.

this trend stood out to me with specific respect to the supreme court in the united kingdom, the state supreme courts in australia and state supreme courts in the united states.

the origins of thewilkinson principle, expressed by wright j, have been attributed to the difficulties faced by his honour with regard to the privy council judgment invictorian railway commission v coultas.while the privy council in subsequent cases, includingjanvier v sweeny andwainwright v home office,has dismissed the notion that there exists a tort outlined inwilkinson, contending that it has been subsumed under the tort of negligence, the supreme court of the united kingdom has upheld its existence.

inrhodes v opo, the supreme court, when forced to consider if thewilkinsonprinciple existed outside of, or separate to, the tort of negligence, held unanimously that it operated independently of the tort of negligence. in spite of the judgments provided in earlier cases by the house of lords dismissing the existence of thewilkinson principle, the supreme court upheld its validity.

this trend is not unique to the united kingdom, however, it is also present in australian law. it is very interesting to see how this trend, that being thediscrepancies between the nations highest court, and that of the state courts, is also observable in australia.

inbunyan v jordan, the high court of australia confirmed the existence of thewilkinson principle in australian tort law. while the plaintiff was ultimately unsuccessful in her claim, thewilkinson principle was ultimately imported into australian law.inmagill v magill, however, the hight court of australia adopted a similar outlook to that of the house of lord, finding in this case that thewilkinson principle had been subsumed under the tort of negligence, citing that thewilkinsonprinciple was simply a short-lived predecessor to negligence.

however, in spite of the judgement of the high court, finding that thewilkinsonprinciple had been subsumed under the tort of negligence, it has been recognised at the state appellant level in victoria in giller v procopets, new south wales innationwide news v naiduand queensland incarrier v bonham.

the state appellant courts within australia can be argued to follow an identifiable trend similar to that of the united kingdom, whereby the state courts are choosing to identify and uphold the thewilkinsonprinciple in the face of higher authority, either from the high court or the house of lords, finding that it has been subsumed under the tort of negligence.

further to this, i think one of the most interesting case studies with respect to this trend is found in the united states. due to the sheer number of jurisdictions, and the lack of a final appeals court, thewilkinsonprinciple has been upheld in a number of states. in the united states, judges who wish to escape the case law of their own jurisdiction are able to borrow horizontally across other jurisdictions. this, combined with the early articulation of thewilkinsonprinciple in the united states, it has permitted this tort to develop extensively.

i'm curious to know if anyone else thought this was an interesting trend, and if so, what your thoughts might have been on this.

thanks!

"workshop 1:
answer the following questions, referring to r vbrown [1994] 1 ac 212 and noting the differences between the majority and minority views of the judges/lords in that case:
1.   what are the aims of punishing those who contravene the law?

deterrence  dont want to encourage this behaviour


harm  protection of the community and society

not a question of sex but violence


both physically and psychologically


consequences of dubious or uninformed consent



protection of society  potential risk to society, and also protecting society from themselves (paternalistic view).

lord jaunceys ruling was that the possibility of proselytisation and corruption of young men is a real danger.


2.   what are the values behind criminal law and where do they come from?

morality

private vs. public



right to not be harmed


value = justice


preservation of public decency


in the past the values behind criminal law came from religious beliefs. these days, due to a secular society, the values of criminal law come from a much greater view of society, not just necessarily the catholic church.


the government represents the views, values and beliefs of the majority of society, and the legislature passes acts that reflects these beliefs.


3.   should crimes vary between jurisdictions?

crimes should vary between different countries, to the extent that the law should factor in cultural differences of separate societies.


it is difficult to maintain a universal moral code / standard that all citizens in the world should be governed by.

however, crimes such as murder to an extent can be considered universal (although countries who implement the death penality can contradict this)



crimes should also vary between states in australia, dependent on the requirements of the society.

for example, in victoria the age at which one can drive on their red p-plates is 18, due to a prevalence of irresponsible driving, which was not common in other states, such as new south wales.



core values should be maintained within all states in terms of criminal legislation an individual should not be able to commit a serious crime and be charged or prosecuted differently (more or less harshly) depending on what state the crime was committed (specifically australia)  uniformity in matters that are supreme court and above


4.   should crimes change with the times and how should that be decided?

crimes should change with the times. as society progresses, their views and values change. it is necessary to implement new crimes or retract old crimes, to uphold a criminal code that is representative of society, and to protect society from new harms that arise.

for example, in australia, the new cyberbullying laws have been implemented to protect those from harm online, and to reflect the broader values of society.



crimes are decided through the consensus of society. citizens of australia vote in a new government every four years, the politicians are voted in to reflect the views of the majority of society, and will criminalise acts that the majority of the society believes to be unlawful.

if governments fails to uphold the views, values and beliefs of society they will be voted out of government at the next election, and a new group of politicians will be voted in to represent the views, values and beliefs of the majority of society.



in the r v brown case, it is widely acknowledged by the justices that the criminalisation of homosexuality has been revoked through acts of parliament to represent the changing views and values of society.


secondly, in the r v brown case, they also refer to the criminalisation of prize fights and duelling, due to the change in societal beliefs.

"activity 2: (where is activity 1? perhaps not needed here)
how likely is patient misidentification of the scale described in the reading?
in my limited clinical experience, i have seen only a handful of incidents where patients were incorrectly identified, and these situations were rectified promptly. 
most incidents did not progress to the extent described in the reading. 
the most recent experience i had of this was during my haematology rotation. 
patients on the ward frequently require blood products, such as packed red blood cells and platelets. 
one particular room accommodated two patients with similar names - one was to receive regular packed red blood cells 
while the other was to received irradiated packed red blood cells. 

fortunately, the nursing staff require two health professionals to approve products before administration, 
and this allowed them to identify that the products had in fact been mixed up between these two patients.

what defences help protect the patient from this? to use the swiss cheese analogy  what are the slices of cheese?
for administration of blood products, there are 5 main processes in place to prevent patient misidentification:

prescription: doctors are required to chart any blood products in the online system digitally, as well as in the patient file physically.

collection: when blood is collected for cross-matching, patients are asked to identify themselves to the phlebotomist, and all samples are labelled as soon as the specimen is collected.

lab processing: once the cross-matched product is ordered, they are delivered physically to the lab by an orderly, and each ordered product is labelled with the patient the product is for.

confirmation: most nursing staff also confirm that blood product administration orders have not been cancelled by the doctor by re-checking the digital and physical patient file.

administration: immediately prior to administering the product, nurses are required to confirm patient details again to ensure they match the details labelled on the product, and then have a 2nd nurse to confirm this; additionally, the patient wrist-band is scanned to ensure that the system is also able to check patient identification.
what are the potential holes in these defences?

one of the major issues encountered in the ward was using the aforementioned 5 processes with non-english-speaking patients as they may often difficulty answering identification questions in a language that they cannot speak. 
labs may infrequently affix the wrong patient labels to the wrong products. 
this is more likely to occur with normal vs irradiated red cells as the text on the product that differentiates between these two can sometimes be difficult to see. 
finally, if the nursing 2-point check is performed using bed name rather than patient name (e.g. confirmation for bed 20 for red cells rather than confirmation for john smith for red cells) can create confusion as well.


activity 3:
what is your role now and as a junior doctor in strengthening these defences? 
how can you help make sure things happen to the right patient and not to the wrong patient?

one of the simplest and most effective strategies i have witnessed is using the patients full name when referring to them. 
this should apply to all clinical activities from making referrals to performing procedures as it removes all ambiguity for both discussing parties. 
another strategy may be to get into a habit of checking the labels of patient files (whether physical or digital) each time the file is opened, 
a note is saved or a prescription order is put through. 

finally, any papers and documentation should have patient labels affixed on them prior to writing on them to ensure it is not confused for another patients forms. developing good strategies as a junior doctor will hopefully translate to these practices becoming second nature as i get more clinical experience, 
and reduce the risk of patient misidentification by playing my own part in the swiss cheese model.",1,M,HINDI

"key points from the lecture
        the social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. 
these are shaped by the way money, power and resources are distributed at global, national and local levels.

        a person high up in the social gradient e.g. someone at a higher rank at the office, is more likely to have better health outcome 
and a higher life expectancy than someone lower the social gradient.

        risk factors increases the chances of one contracting a disease or suffering from injuries.

        health inequality is the difference in the presence of disease, health outcomes, or access to health between population groups. 
while health inequities are inequalities that are the result of unfairness or injustice.

        social determinants of health can be dealt with through policy modifications and interventions.
things i found interesting

        unemployment does not only impact ones ability to pay essential bills, access health services etc., it could also affect ones relationship with family, friends or former colleagues (in essence the mental and social well-being of the person) thereby putting them at risk (risk factor) to certain health conditions.


discussion question
question: what are the major determinants of health in your country and how are these addressed?

in my country, the major determinant to health is unemployment. 
more than 50% of qualified individuals/ people with a degree are unemployed. 
a majority of youth graduate and go without jobs or a steady income for years and most times this is the case for the rest of their lives. 
this means that they are deprived of a lot basics for example good housing, food, good education, basic healthcare, proper sanitation and so on. 

these conditions affect their quality of life drastically and in turn their health.  
one of the major problems faced when trying to deal with this issue in the country is corruption and lack of planning. 
most times we see that there have been really good policies and interventions formulated to curb the problem 
but those in power want to remain in power and enjoy all the benefits( money and good things) that come with it, at the expense of the masses. 
even times where there is an effort made to create jobs, it only gets to a few people due to the large population of unemployed people 
and the little budget available to spend. 
moreover, engaging in several vocational jobs like catering, hair styling, truck driving etc. have been able to cater to basic needs of some individuals. 
while on the other hand of the spectrum, unemployment have also increased the risk of social exclusion, addiction, stress, and petty crime, 
which also has an impact on health.",1,F,IGBO
"its interesting to hear how the ecatt team at mmc operates, as i havent personally encountered a similar team during my placements. likewise in my placement, communication was seen as a vital factor in the management of patients, especially between healthcare professionals. i wonder if there is anything that the team can do in situations where they are unable to gain information from the patients pcp, considering that it could prevent the patient from receiving the care that they desperately need.",0,F,ENGLISH
"3. you are presented with an intubated pneumonia patient presenting with the following arterial blood gas. 
within the limitations of this patient description, interpret these findings and explain how you might modify the ventilation settings accordingly.

po2 70mmhg
pco2 68mmhg
ph 7.21
bicarb 26
be -3

arterial blood gas analysis provides the opportunity to gain an insight into the patients gas exchange, acid-base balance and ventilatory function.
(1) in the setting of an intubated and mechanically ventilated patient such insight allows a clinician to more accurately tailor ventilation settings to optimise and improve the patients condition.

(2) when first considering abg values it is convention to compare them to physiologically normal ranges to ascertain what components may be abnormal and then seek to consider these abnormalities in the context of the underlying pathophysiology. (1, 3)
with specific reference to the abg values provided;
-        pao2 normal range is 80-100mmhg with the patient demonstrating hypoxaemia at 70mmhg 
-        paco2 normal range is 35-45mmhg with the patients value elevated at 68mmhg
-        ph normal range is 7.35 -7.45 with the patient being acidotic at 7.21
-        bicarb normal range is 22-26mmol/l with the patients value within normal range at 26
-        base excess (be) normal range is -2 to +2mmol/l with the patients value lowered at -3

pneumonia is an infection of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi and through the associated inflammation and accumulation of infiltrates normal gaseous exchange is inhibited. 

(4) with this information combined we can seek to deduce that this patient is experiencing a respiratory acidosis and hypoxaemia secondary to pneumonia. 
the following ventilator setting adjustments may assist in improving this intubated patients hypoxaemia, hypercarbia and acidosis;

fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) 
increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen towards 1.0 seeks to increase the partial pressure of oxygen available within the alveoli and correspondingly seeks to increase pao2. it is often one of the first steps employed by clinicians when first applying mechanical ventilation to correct hypoxaemia.(5) it is acknowledged however that as a long term strategy high fio2 can generate a proinflammatory state, oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis (5-7)

positive end expiratory pressure (peep)
providing and increasing peep seeks to assist in recruiting closed and maintaining open alveoli therefore improving and maintaining functional residual capacity (frc). an increase in frc provides an increased surface area for gaseous exchange which may assist in both oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide.(7)
peep may be controlled directly by the ventilator or via an externally attached valve. it is conventionally started at 5cmh20 to replicate physiological peep and increased for therapeutic purposes within the range of 5-20cmh20.(7)

minute volume: tidal volume x frequency
adjusting minute volume through an adjustment in either tidal volume or frequency is considered the primary means through which mechanical ventilation can seek to facilitate removal of additional co2 and reversal of hypercapnia.(6) adjustments in these settings however must be balanced against exposing the patient to barotrauma (excessive pressure) or volutrauma (excessive volume). lung protective strategies are a series of evidenced based strategies that seek to reduce the risk of ventilator related lung injury.(6) research suggests that volutrauma is the major contributing factor to acute lung injury and accordingly the current recommended strategy is to limit tidal volume based on 6-8ml/kg of the patients ideal body weight.(6, 7)
in order to adjust minute volume, frequency is therefore the variable most often adjusted as it affords greater range of adjustment prior to exceeding physiologically safe parameters.(6, 7) in this setting increasing the patients minute volume through an increase in frequency would be the first considered step to assist in reducing hypercapnia. after this a recalculation of the patients tidal volume based on the upper end of the recommended scale at 8ml/kg would be undertaken.

inspiratory time
increasing the inspiratory time (time over which the ventilator delivers the inspiratory portion of the respiratory cycle) may allow for increased overall gaseous exchange through a corresponding increase in mean airway pressure. (7, 8) such an approach is of potential benefit in the pneumonia patient whom is displaying poor lung compliance and may be reaching high peak inspiratory and plateau pressures. (9)
depending on adjustable features of the mechanical ventilator being used this may be achieved through directly altering an inspiratory time setting or through adjusting the inspiratory: expiratory (i:e) ratio. an associated change to the inspiratory flow rate (l/min) may also be required or occur. in this patient adjusting the inspiratory time to facilitate an i:e ratio of 1:1 may be of benefit. (5, 7)

non-ventilator setting derived strategies
finally a number of other additional strategies that are not technically ventilator settings but may work synergistically with the ventilator setting changes suggested above include patient positioning in a more upright positioning and not supine, optimisation of the patients haemodynamic state and treatment of the underlying condition, in this case pneumonia.(5, 6, 10)

"1) who were participants?
according to the article, participants included anyone eating quality street and roses chocolates.

2) what is the study design? look up and define what this type of design entails.
the study design was a multicentre (meaning that it is a clinical trial that is conducted at more than one medical centre or hospital), prospective (which is a study that, over time, follows a group of differing individuals with respect to certain factors, to determine how these factors affect rates of a certain outcome), covert observational study (meaning that the researchers identity, the nature of thestudy, and the fact that participants are being observed, was concealed from those who were being studied).

3) what was the objective or research question for the study?
the objective of the study was to quantify the consumption of chocolates in a hospital ward environment.

4) what were the key outcomes?
the median survival time of a chocolate was 51 minutes.
the model of chocolate consumption was non-linear.
an exponential decay model best fitted these findings, with a survival half-life of 99 minutes.
quality street chocolates survived longer than roses chocolates.
the highest percentages of chocolates were consumed by healthcare assistants (28%) and nurses (28%), followed by doctors (15%).

5) how were the outcomes measured?
the main outcome measurement for this study was the median survival time of a chocolate.

6) what were the key recommendations from the study?
it is the authors' opinion that the frequency of chocolates delivered to wards needs to be increased and manufacturers lobbied [should] stop further shrinkage of chocolate boxes. this is recommended to ensure that all healthcare staff get the same benefits from consistent chocolate consumption.
(summarising answer from reading?)

7) summarise the conclusions of the study?
the article concluded by stating that chocolate survival in a hospital ward was relatively short. this was modelled well by an exponential decay model. roses chocolates were more preferred in comparison to the quality street chocolates. overall, healthcare assistants and nurses were the primary consumers of the chocolates, followed by doctors.

8) how does this contribute to the body of knowledge in the field?
it contributes indirectly. although it doesnt directly relate to nursing practices it highlights the urgency that some healthcare workers have to replenish their energy levels with sugary treats.

9) did the authors provide sufficient information to allow the study to be replicated?
yes, the method was comprehensible and clear enough for the study to be replicated.

10) does this article and activity demonstrate evidence base for practice?
no, it does not demonstrate evidence base for practice.",1,F,ENGLISH
"away from her mother may cause stress to her, as her mother acted as the primary caregiver.

this may also explain her intention on bringing online articles during consultation.",1,F,MANDARIN
"1. describe the physiological state of these two patients with specific reference to diagnosis, clinical severity and likely clinical pathway in the next 12-24 hours. the intent here is to clearly demonstrate you understand what is going on with these two patients, given the information at hand.

bazza
it appears that bazzas respiratory status has improved with his four hour stint on bipap, however, he still remains in moderate respiratory distress with rr of 22, infective and obstructive chest sounds, significant increase in wob with minimal exertion, tired and tachycardic. the treatment that has been given - seretide, ventolin, atrovent, and hydrocortisone may have improved the copd component of his presentation but he still remains significantly respiratory compromised. consideration also needs to be given to pe and cardiac failure/ apo in this patient.
bazza meets sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) criteria (febrile, rr &gt;20, hr &gt;90, low wcc) and in this setting is suggestive of community acquired pneumonia (cap). this needs to be confirmed with chest x-ray. smart cop assessment criteria (see image below) can be used to determine his likelihood of requiring intensive respiratory or vasopressor support (irvs)(1). depending on cxr and albumin levels, he is likely to be moderate to high risk, which indicates he would benefit from icu treatment. bazza requires further treatment including administration of iv fluids and 2nd antibiotic such as doxycycline or a macrolide (2) to prevent progression to septic shock and multi organ dysfunction syndrome (mods).

abgs show a respiratory acidosis with a ph of 7.29 and pco2 of 51. hco3 of 21 and be of -6 also indicates some metabolic acidosis as well. whether the metabolic acidosis is attributed to his current illness or his chronic conditions (most likely has liver disease/cirrhosis as well as multiple other poorly managed co-morbidities) may not be known at this point.

concentrated urine with borderine output and elevated urea and creatinine indicates some degree of kidney injury(3) . this suggests hypoperfusion despite having adequate bp at this stage. bazza needs iv fluids to assist with this. hyperglycaemia in the setting of sepsis doubles mortality (4) so it is extremely important to control this.

some more information is required to determine the trajectory for bazza, specifically an analysis of his trends from arrival at ed and since being taken off bipap.
if bazza receives the correct treatment for the above problems, and assuming his trends show he has been improving, his trajectory over the next 12-24hours is likely positive. he does however have significant co-morbidities that increase the complexity of his management. if he were to be moved now he will likely deteriorate considering his episode of aphasia post coughing episode. inability to fly patients on niv due to risk of deteriorating enroute would likely mean that bazza would end up intubated for flight if he were transported now. intubation and mechanical ventilation of this cohort of patients is associated with significantly higher mortality of 25-39%(5). it may be beneficial for bazza to stay at clifton to try to optimise his condition to a point where he can be safely flown to branxton unintubated.

luke
luke is a multi trauma case with suspected traumatic brain injury (tbi) and acute abdomen. he needs to be taken to a paediatric major trauma service (mts) immediately. he presents with a gcs of 9 leading to high suspicion of tbi which requires neurosurgical care as soon as possible. considering the patient was conscious post the accident this is likely a secondary brain injury. the deterioration in conscious state could be an indication of increasing intracranial pressure (icp). prevention of further brain injury is the priority until the patient can be handed over to a (mts). luke also needs definitive management of his acute abdomen and further imaging to assess for other injuries, such as spine, pelvis, chest and limbs. without correct treatment and speedy transfer, the likely trajectory of luke is further deterioration and possibly death.

2. state two priority decisions you believe need to be made prior to commencing comprehensive patient management. briefly discuss your rationale for raising these decisions as a priority and provide your answer for each of them.

1) which patient is higher priority and needs retrieving first?  luke, obviously his trajectory is much worse and needs definitive care eg neurosurgery. bazza can be provided with the immediate treatment he needs at this facility. he can be managed for a few more hours or until the morning at clifton, preferably in the hdu and be retrieved when another team is available.

2) do we get luke to ct or x-ray before transferring him?  delaying lukes transfer to the mts would delay access to definitive care and therefore could lead to further deterioration. this can be discussed on the phone with the paediatric retrieval consultant, but considering a radiographer will need to be called in to the hospital this would be an unnecessary delay. if radiographer can get to hospital within 30mins, x-ray to confirm ett placement may be of benefit if it can be done without delay. concerns regarding possible pneumothorax or pneumocranium can be managed by flying with a sea level cabin in the absence of imaging. 

3. detail your immediate management strategies needed to be achieved within the first 30 minutes of this retrieval and your brief rationale. be reasonable in what you can achieve here!
alert fcc of change of plan, and update them with bazzas current condition and advise of treatment plan you have left staff with for him. request another team to retrieve bazza when available, could potentially wait until the morning if improvement with management plan. 
contact the paediatric retrieval consultant to inform them of patient condition and the teams proposed management, see if they would like any other management initiated

update pilot to change of patient and destination
management of luke
reassurance for mother, confirm hx of event, gain lukes phx, meds, allergies, ongoing assessment of mothers fitness to fly with us
finish assessment  bgl, pupillary response, can perform ultrasound to check for abdominal bleeding or pneumothorax. may determine need for blood products if large amount of free blood discovered.
connect to our monitoring
spinal immobilisation
pelvic splint may be of benefit even though pelvic injury isnt obvious
2 x iv access
although luke has a reduced gcs he is likely in pain considering the injuries he has sustained. administration of small amounts of opiate will make patient comfortable and allow for continuation of management.
pt needs warming, aiming for normothermia (6) cover patient with warm blankets in layers, used warmed fluids for pre-hydration if available.
if enough staff at hospital recruit team for planning and performing rsi  if staff too busy recruit just prior to rsi but communicate plan and define roles prior to beginning procedure. utilise ambulance crew that are transporting retrieval crew to and from airfield.
set up for rsi following checklist
planning  discuss and confirm plan a and plan b if things dont go to plan
preparation of scene and patient
prepare all equipment for failed intubation, modify environment for best access to patient and equipment, move things around to suit the team
position supine may need padding under shoulders, sniffing position
pre-oxygenation 15l via nrb and 15l via nasal prongs  very important as children desaturate quickly
pre-hydration 10ml/kg normal saline, if warmed fluids available, use to provide warming.
pharmacology, medications of choice  ketamine, suxamethonium, pancuronium, morph/midaz infusion (7). noradrenaline to be drawn up for bp management if hypotensive despite iv fluids (6). delegate nursing staff to draw up all medications and infusions and label clearly (specific instructions  can write down so no confusion)
when ready to intubate go over plan again and seek confirmation from team that everyone knows their roles and responsibilities.
main principles of care throughout case is to avoid secondary brain injury  maintain cerebral perfusion pressure and adequate ventilation at all times, avoid hypotension and hypoxia (6, 8)

plan for bazza
ask staff to do following and then call back arv to update them with bazzas status
12 lead ecg
iv fluids  start with nacl 20ml/kg checking chest at 250ml increments
chest x-ray and sputum culture to be taken, ? blood cultures taken prior to antibiotic administration?
second antibiotic commenced (doxycycline or a macrolide)(2)
second stint of bipap if required, inspiratory pressure 10cmh2o, expiratory pressure
3-5cmh2o and fio2 0.5
manage hyperglycaemia
repeat abgs to see trends post management
can bazza be moved to hdu until he can be retrieved?
organise with fcc to send another crew to retrieve possibly in the morning - follow up progress/trends post this treatment plan.

"although oliver's remarks were disrespectful and inappropriate, they are not unethical. 
the difference between the two is that appropriateness in this context is determined by morals, 
which are subjective and fluid, whilst ethics are objectively determined and explicitly stated. 

as long as oliver has not identified the donor body during the conversation, his statements are technically ethical even if made in poor taste.
upon hearing these remarks, maria could be encouraged to stop her grandmother's body from being donated 
to prevent her body being ridiculed by the likes of oliver. 

ari and oliver should be aware this as they directly benefit from the kindness of donors. 
their comments could dissuade further donors.
the use of donor bodies comes with ethical obligations to treat the body with respect and in a decent manner as courtesy to the donor family.",1,M,ENGLISH

"due to the differences that exist between people based on ethnicity, cultural and spiritual beliefs, maternal issues proves to be a challenge for paramedics on the road. indigenous australians and people from culturally and diverse backgrounds (cald) subscribe to health beliefs that are different from the australian health care system, therefore presenting challenges to management of maternal conditions in out of hospital environment. 
some ways in which this ia a challenge include,

1. age difference between the attending paramedic and client
in some african and indigenous cultures, it is considered disrespectful for a young person to uncover the nakedness of an older individual. 
however, it is culturally appropriate for the individual to be attended to by someone of the same age or older. 
this creates a challenge for the younger paramedics.

2. gender of the attending paramedic
in most cultures particularly of people from cald, it is a traboo for a male to be involved in maternal issues (indians). 
men are not allowed participate in maternaland labor issues because it is the sole responsibility of women. 
it is common with ambulance victoria to have an all male crew attending which creates challenges with maternal issues for people who subscribe to this belief.

3 culturally acceptable lines of communication
indigenous culture subscribe to the belief of nothing about us without us. 
this means that client has autonomy concerning the type of health service they want to recieve and how they want to recieve it. 
paramedic must be sensitive to preferences of the client and refrain from paternalistic approach of health service delivery in order to gain informed consent. sometimes, the communication is done through family members or clan kingship especially in the aboriginal culture.
with this challenges, it is important for call centre tom establish details concerning patient beliefs and preferences prior to release of resources to ensure that service are appropriate to the needs of individuals.",1,M,SETSWANA
"healthcare systems and organisations seek to become more efficient and effective, while best utilising limited resources. de-implementing inappropriate health interventions is essential for minimizing patient harm in order to improve population health 1.

in my field of allied health, as previously discussed, evidence based practice is central to how we practice, however this can vary significantly between therapists own treatment biases, values, beliefs and backgrounds. 

allied health therapists adopt clinical guidelines in their treatment, which are considered to decrease the gap between research and current practice, reducing inappropriate and/or ineffective practice2. 

however clinical guidelines are simply that, a guideline, which can vary depending on the therapists beliefs, experience and treatment biases. 
in our physiotherapy department, there appears to be a significant gap between those early adopters5of therapists, 
and the late majority5, where the early adopters challenge ineffective processes first, proving need for change. 

yet, changing practice and de-implementation of ineffective processes has it challenges, which is multi-level. 
norton &amp; chambers, (2020)1described the multiple challenges at which de-implementation is affected, including:
health intervention characteristics
relating to the complexity of the health intervention, for example changing an intervention that has been utilised for a long time, versus a more modern evidence based intervention.

patient characteristics
central to any intervention is providing patient centred care, however de-implementing interventions or patient beliefs around therapy can prove extremely challenging.for example, a patient may belief that manual therapy only is the panacea for treating lower back pain, where current research suggests a biopsychosocial approach4is more effective. 

health professional characteristics
individual past experiences of practice change, with associated negative effects or outcomes, can be seen as a challenge of de-implementing. the complexity of the individuals own beliefs, experience and treatment bias will again play a role here.
organisational characteristics
culture, department climate, resources, proactive leadership and open management all play a vital role of change,and whether de-implementation alters revenue streams or income for the organisation.

"patton concludes in his discussion in the lancet that ""for most women, perinatal depressive symptoms are best regarded as a continuation or recurrence of problems beginning well before pregnancy."" 

he has demonstrated that there is a significantly higher risk of the development of perinatal depressive symptoms in women with a history of mental health problems in adolescence and young adulthood. 
in 85% of pregnancies with perinatal depressive symptoms, the mothers had a history of mental health problems. 
the odds of a woman with a history of mental health disorders in both adolescence and young adulthood developing perinatal depression is 8 times that of a woman 
with no history (or 8.26, 95% ci 3.34-20.87). 

for women who had mental health disorders only in young adulthood had four (or 457, 95% ci 1541353) times the odds of developing perinatal depression than those with no history. 
the confidence interval is not very precise, given its width, but it is still technically statistically significant. 

however, the data also shows that cases of perinatal depression occur without a history of mental health conditions, 
24% (95%ci 20-29) of women with perinatal depressive symptoms had no past history. 
60% (95% ci 55-64). of women with a significant history did not develop perinatal depression. 

there are more factors, social, biological and environmental, that influence the development of depressive symptoms during or after pregnancy. 
to draw the conclusion that these symptoms are simply a continuation of pre-existing disease fails to recognise the multifactorial nature of this condition. 
while it is important to identify high risk women and ensure suitable support is provided to them, 
it is also important to remember that women with no risk factors also develop perinatal depressive symptoms.",1,F,ENGLISH

"psychiatric diagnostic and treatment errors cause significant amounts of iatrogenic harm to patients each year, 
and place an additional burden of illness on australian healthcare systems (1). 

as a psychiatry registrar working in a victorian public hospital, i see and (!) make such errors that have the potential to cause harm,and which unfortunately sometimes do. 
im currently being trained in consultation liaison psychiatry, and this assessment has led me to critically reflect on the main workplace errors made by clinicians on my team. 
though i was able to identify many domains of error, one such domain that is particularly risky and relevant to my current practice is over-sedation of clients in response to behaviours of concern driven by acute mental illness on the medical wards. 

for example, a common situation in my day-to-day practice is being asked for advice on managing the risk of aggression in patients intoxicated with methamphetamine, and being asked to prescribe intramuscular sedative medications that mitigate such risks. one significant risk of chemical sedation is iatrogenic respiratory distress, often requiring life support measures to resuscitate and stabilise patients. 

in constructing my quantitative research question i utilised the pico method (2), standing for patient, intervention, comparison and outcome respectively (keywords underlined): 
p: patients admitted to medical hospital wards in australia experiencing psychosis 
i: administration of intramuscular antipsychotics 
c: administration of intramuscular benzodiazepines
o: respiratory distress requiring intubation 
research question:
do patients admitted to medical wards in australian hospitals who are experiencing an acute psychosis administered with intramuscular antipsychotics experience higher rates of respiratory distress requiring intubation compared to those administered intramuscular benzodiazepines? 
null hypothesis (h0):
patients admitted to medical wards in australian hospitals experiencing an acute psychosis who are administered intramuscular antipsychotics do not experience higher rates of respiratory distress requiring intubation compared to those administered intramuscular benzodiazepines. 

alternative hypothesis (ha):
patients admitted to medical wards in australian hospitals experiencing an acute psychosis who are administered intramuscular antipsychotics experience higher rates of respiratory distress requiring intubation compared to those administered intramuscular benzodiazepines.

"hello solomon,
i loved reading your write-up. thank you so much for putting things into perspective.
mental health continues to be a prominent plague in todays world (1) (5). 
the negative outcomes on the effects of mental health with reference to social media outweigh the positives. 
however, i have personally found social media as a benefit to deal with certain periods of persistent sadness or depressive moods. 
to be able to express my thoughts out loud and receive response has momentarily uplifted downheartedness. 
nowadays, social media influencers have started responsibly sharing content that reaches out to the audience, resulting in a positive effect. 

moreover, studies have shown that social media can be used to reach out to those who show symptoms of depression and tackle the situation(3) (4).
a study funded by the national institute of mental health developed a test to determine the effectiveness of depression treatment. known as the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (star*d): it reported depression remission rates of over 65 per cent after six months of treatment. develop, and test an algorithm to identify major depressive disorder (mdd) via social media(3).

using social media as an advantage requires responsibility. by responsibility, i mean to say, having a thorough idea about the dangers lurking in social media due to the inherent lack of privacy and control and conveniently using this knowledge to handle social media. health care professionals working with depressed patients could suggest strategies to improve the quality of online experiences, such as restricting time spent on social media to reduce the number of negative interactions and ""unfriending"" people or groups that tend to enable negative experiences (2) (6).

"-  critically evaluate the role of milk as a post-exercise recovery drink.
studies have shown than milk as a post-exercise recovery drink can have positive benefits to the athlete, demonstrating an impact on glycogen resynthesis, muscle protein synthesis and hydration status.

from the slr, evidence suggest that dairy milk enhanced mixed muscle protein synthesis as well as showing similar rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis compared to an iso-caloric non-nitrogenous carbohydrate replacement beverage. 
results demonstrated the protein content of a dairy milk recovery beverage (0.2 g/kgbm/h) can stimulate overall muscle protein synthesis as milk contains a high content of essential amino acids, particularly leucine. 

additionally, dairy milk showed significant differences in glycogen replenishment, when compared to iso-caloric beverages with higher carbohydrate contents as the protein content of the dairy milk beverages aided muscle glycogen resynthesis, 
therefore, the combination of both carbohydrate and protein content in milk showed an increase in muscle glycogen replenishment rates in comparison to carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages. 

finally, due to the higher energy density in dairy milk, it may delay gastric emptying and intestinal transit, which in turn delays the delivery of water into circulation which can decrease the risk of hypervolaemia as well as reducing the decline in plasma osmolarity therefore increased water clearance by the kidney. however, more research is required on recovery beverages and hydration status using other methods to determine a more accurate result.

-  make a statement on whether or not milk is a good post-exercise recovery option.
from this systematic review, milk has shown to have many positive aspects when it comes to post exercise recovery. i believe due to its high amount of natural essential amino acids and carbohydrate content it can be a good source of these nutrients after exercise. conversely, there is a need for more research with regards to its effect on hydration status and gastrointestinal complications.

"people with severe or enduring mental health illness can be difficult to engage with due to various factors. 
disengagement can be related to utility, attitude and practicality(dixon, holoshitz, &amp; nossel, 2016). 
resistance and ambivalence about change are increasingly recognized as important determinants of treatment outcomes (button, westra, hara, &amp; aviram, 2015). often mental health consumers have complex and multiple needs and engagement is key to better health outcomes, as dixon et al. (2016) notes that poor engagement may lead to worse clinical outcomes, with symptom relapse and rehospitalization.

in regards to choosing a consumer who displays issues with engagement, i have chosen jenny, who is defensive. jenny is a 40 year old female with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and depression and has an extensive history of substance abuse in particular ice. she is a well known client to mental health services and often has relapses due to substance use. jenny is a mother of three, with ages ranging from 10 to 19 years. jenny resides at community care unit (ccu) while her eldest child looks after the younger children at the family home 100km away from the facility. jenny is unemployed and is on the disability support pension, previously worked at a local pub but due to frequent substance use was fired. she is often defensive and reluctant to engage with staff and has a negative view on mental health services and distrusts the system.

regarding strategies to improve jennys engagement, the use of person centered care was utilised, as it is the foundation to client care. patient centred care is health care that is respectful of, and responsive to the preferences, needs and values of consumers (australian commission on safety and quality in health care [acsqhc], 2011). on top of this fundamental approach, the method of motivational interviewing was incorporated to enhance the means for open communications. motivational interviewing, while a learnable set of techniques, is more importantly a style or approach to assisting clients in resolving ambivalence and changing behaviour (hall mcmaster &amp; associates [hma], 2016).given jenny is currently residing at a ccu, her length of stay is extended and the catchment period allows for further time to build rapport over time and address barriers of engagement.

whilst adhering to the principles and the core aspects of motivational interviewing to elicit change, i utilised the process of oars skills; open ended questions, affirmations, reflections and summaries in regards to jenny.

open ended questions- jenny initially reluctant to engage but opened up and shared information about her experiences and feelings with substance use. this proved to be far more effective than closed questions.
affirmations- validating her recent hardships and her accomplishments, especially in regards to her family.
reflections- reflecting and repeating back to jenny what she had shared in conversation and allowing time for jenny to process this information. and so reflecting on her loss of family support and feeling guilty about not being around them.
summaries- discussing what had been shared and jenny articulating a desire to make goals and plan to seek further support for her substance addiction and counselling for depression.
central to motivational interviewing is the importance of avoiding confrontation and working in a collaborative spirit, in a manner that can motivate clients to engage in the process and enable them to identify their strengths whilst feeling supported to take ownership of their difficulties (australian institute of family studies [aifs], 2013). people have great capacity to adapt to loss and change, given the access to connectedness and support.

"hi chris,
i'm a bit torn on whether or not it would be considered ethical. 

one on hand, i feel like using emotive language and anecdotes makes the viewers more likely to care about the issue. 
as alysha mentioned, there didn't seem to be much community outrage though this may be because of the comments made by the members of the government. 

i think that if the community showed more of a response to the research that alison and the rest of the team did then maybe the government would have been more likely to do further testing. 

on the other hand, scientific literature is objective by convention. 
science reflects objective evidence and scientists convey this evidence in objective ways. 
combining science with journalism would be difficult since journalism is more focused on subjective points of views and bring in the audience's attention. 
what does everyone else think?",1,F,ENGLISH
"nature:
children can inherit genetic conditions from their parents which can affect their development such as dyslexia.
an individuals phenotype can determine how they are treated in society. for example individuals who have coloured skin are more likely to encounter racism and discrimination which may impact their mental health.
children may be born with congenital diseases such as down syndrome or tricuspid atresia which impacts the childs development and behaviour.

nurture:
social surroundings has a large impact on how we behave since children learn by observing others such as their parents. for example the cycle of violence, ifparents displayed violent behaviour, there is an increase chance of the child also being violent in the future.
socio-economic status, if the individual has the income to seek healthcare, they are more likely to be in better health compared to those with low income.
culture can influence behaviour as they can dictate the types of healthcare the person can receive, health remedies and change perspective on illnesses and death.

opinion:
i think that both nature and nurture have influences on our development. however, i believe that nurture has a greater influence as we have more control over this factor. for example, if someone has a family history/genes for type 2 diabetes it doesnt mean that they are guaranteed develop diabetes but they have greater chance of developing the disease. therefore, it is up to the person to change their behaviour such as ensuring that they are eating healthy and being physically active to reduce their chances of developing the disease.",1,F,CANTONESE

some reasons as to why common data elements were reported differently in the 3 projects include:
the 3 students were provided 3 different projects, therefore the projects may have different aims, inclusion and exclusion criteria. this will result in each project using a different combination of data from the same dataset to draw their conclusions. 
different definitions for common data elements may have been used by the students, thus resulting in some variables having different values/ranges under investigation.
in the instance of there being data without dates in the dataset, each project may formulate different decision rules to consider which data will be considered for the project. 
data for particular variables may have been collected at different times throughout the period of data collection and thus, each student may have had access to different amounts of data at a given time.

"this is a relevant issue of debate and i think there is no definite answer of yes or no. 
i believe that ""blame"" refers to a specific connotation that relies on pointing fingers for mistakes 
or negative outcomes that occurred and thus using such word seems like a negative andunconstructive start. 
substitute like 'responsibility' and 'accountability' would be more sensible.

throughout medical career, there will be a lot of unexpected circumstances that happens even when all the efforts has been done. 
this causes problems when doctors start to blame themselves for the mistakes done. 
self blaming if done in a healthy matter helps to promote self-reflection 
and hence more careful and safe approach will be adopted if the doctor is faced with a similar situation in the future. 

however, taking excessive responsibility would have detrimental mental health effects on the doctors, 
which can deteriorate their work performance in a long run.
in my opinion, rather than blaming an individual for a certain outcome, 
there should be collective reflection amongst the entire team on what factors contributed to this undesirable outcome 
as according to swiss cheese model of error, mistakes often cannot be attributed to a single person, 
but rather involve multiple individual weakness in a larger system.",1,M,"CHINESE, NEC"

3) vaccinate- people take various of vaccine at their younger age to boost their immunity and antibody formation. which will prevent the probability of people to diagnose particular diseases.

secondary prevention:
1) alcohol disinfection- due to the coronavirus, the community had given each household a bottle of alcohol to sterilize their house. which will help to kill the virus and bacterias, and prevent the exist of coronavirus.

3) regular health check- in china, most work unit will provide a health check once a year. this help people to acknowledge their health condition and detect disease at early stage, also prevent deterioration of the diseases.

tertiary prevention:

2) chemotherapy- chemotherapy is a therapy that metastatic and kill cancer cells. which will help cancer patients to conquer cancer and extend their life.
3) self isolation- currently the coronavirus are spread in china and the healthy authority determined that people who are diagnosed coronavirus must being isolate from others. protective suit such as n95 medical face mask, isolation cloth and goggles are necessary when others need to contact with patient. this prevent the infection of diseases and help reducing the prevalence.",1,F,MANDARIN

discuss fatigue management systems that are used in the aeromedical environment.
fatigue management is highly stringent within the aviation industry. 

the fatigue management systems for the civil and aeromedical sectors are identical 
and these policies and procedures apply to pilots, additional crews and the company itself. 

these policies and procedures are documented in the civil aviation advisory publication (caap) 48-01 v3.1 governed by the civil aviation safety authority (casa).
helicopter emergency services (hems) in america conduct approximately 400,000 flying missions each year transporting patients and transplant organs (1). 

the united states with the support of the american national transport safety board (ntsb) conducted research into the links between pilot error associated with pilot fatigue. 

in this report, the ntsb states that the accident rate for hems operations are unacceptably high. 
this was evident between 2003 and 2008; where there were 85 accidents involving hems airframes and resulted in 77 fatalities (1).

the ntsb recommended the development of a fatigue management system for hems to establish the goal of reducing accidents and subsequently the loss of human life. unfortunately, as stated in the report, it was not possible to manage the fatigue systems at the time of the research paper (2013). 
to date, there has been no research conducted in australia regarding fatigue within the aeromedical field.

in 2014, the organisation casa released a guidance article on fatigue and fatigue management. 
the document provided a vast amount of information for aircrew personnel. 
this included several fatigue models used by various aviation services throughout australia and the rest of the world. 
three main approaches to fatigue management highlighted by casa are basic fatigue management, enhanced fatigue management and the fatigue risk management systems (frms). civil aviation advisory publication 48-01 (caap 48-01).

the basic fatigue management is restrictive in its approach as it sets out duty time and prescriptive flight time limitations. 
this is for operators which do not require an enhanced risk management process (2). limitations are in figure 4 of this paper.
(fig 4.)

enhanced fatigue management (efm) allows greater flexibility regarding duty and flight time limitations. operators are required to implement and monitor their own risk management processes. this is in conjunction with implementing a fatigue management program training package to their flight crew members (fcm). majority of air operators certificate holders will be able to operate within the limits in the caap 48-01 (figure 5).
casa does recognise that there is a diverse nature of operations within the australian aviation industry. casa supports operations that fall slightly outside the characteristics of the efm; but not to the point of requiring a fatigue risk management system. operators may submit a minor variation request to the efm. however, if the operations are not applicable with the efm, operators can access the fatigue risk management system.
(fig 5.)

fatigue risk management system (frms) is the most comprehensive fatigue management approach in caap 48-01. this systems approach is data driven; which requires contact information monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety issues and risks. these are based on scientific principles, knowledge and operational experiences as laid out in caap 48-01 (figure 6). this is to ensure all flight crew members are performing at an adequate level of alertness (2).
(fig 6.)

the most commonly used fatigue management system used within the australian aviation industry is the fatigue assessment tool by inter-dynamics (faid).
faid system: 
inter dynamics designed a bio-mathematical model called the fatigue assessment tool by inter dynamics (faid). 
this system is used to estimate fatigue exposure associated with hours of work. the faid structure has been developed by using scientific research and knowledge gained over many decades. 

key points address includes the circadian rhythm, the effects of shift lengths, timing of shifts, fatigue and performance review from previous work periods. the faid can be customised to assess and manage fatigue exposure of working hours to within fatigue tolerance levels of the industry which this system is being applied (3).
the faid system has been utilised and validated over the last 10 years in simulators, laboratory and most importantly, in the field. the australian rail industry hosted the earliest faid field study in 2001 and 2006. the study was conducted over 5 of the 8 states of australia in conjunction with 193 volunteers, who all are employed as train drivers (4). all train drivers that were involved within the study were shift workers.
before and after each shift for a period of 2 weeks; the study participants completed daily sleep and work diaries, wore actigraphs, performed subjective alertness and objective performance tests. regression results indicate a strong to very strong relationship with logical reasoning, sleep latency scores, self-rated alertness and reaction time. the studies conducted on the rail industry indicated a clear relationship between faid scores, train driving performance, psychomotor vigilance performance and alertness levels (5).
the faid system has several advantages and limitations, which i have included in figure 1 and figure 2.
(fig 1.)

(fig 2.)

circadian alertness simulator:
the circadian alertness simulator (cas) is a bio-mathematical fatigue model assesses an individuals sleep / wake / work pattern within a specific work environment and estimates the fatigue risk. the circadian company has recently released an update to the cas system. this update has been optimised to be utilised for crew planning and other fatigue risk management systems within the aviation industry (3).
the cas fatigue system has been validated in several diverse area of the aviation industry such as transportation operations, long range and ultra-long range passenger services. cas has been continually improved over the last 20 years, utilising large populations of pilots and aircrew operators where sleep and alertness during duty has been measured (3). the cas fatigue management systems does have some advantages and limitations which have been included in figure 3.
(fig 3.)

sleep / wake predictor
the sleep / wake predictor (swp) model is built on the foundations of the original three-process model of alertness. the swp accounts for the effects of sleep inertia, predicts the onset of sleep and terminations of sleep based on the physiological parameters set out in the process model of alertness. this system is designed to predict alertness by determining the level of sleepiness with the associated changes in circadian rhythms and time awake or asleep. the system provides summary report of sleep, sleepiness risk and alertness opportunity for scheduled crews or the situation for tasking (3).
in addition to the information for frms for the aviation industry in australia; the caap 48-01 also has a specific appendix relating to medical transportation and emergency service aircraft. however, to be able to operator outside the realm of normal aviation and function as a medical or emergency service flight, the flight crew must meet a specific criterion in the caap 48-01 as per figure 7. casa does give special dispensation to emergency service and medical aircraft in relation to duty and flight hours. however, during normal flying and duty times without an emergency or medical tasking, aircraft crews are still required to follow the caap 48-01 fatigue management rulings (2).

i think you may have missed my post as you've replied to all in this forum but mine!

"on my gp clinic rotation, i discussed with my gp the role he plays in the healthcare system. 

as a general practitioner, their unique work is to establish first contact with their patients 
and maintain a open and confidential relationship to provide personalised and continuous care. 

by providing such care requires considerable knowledge, compassion and understanding of the patient. 
thus, the gp would continue to coordinate appropriate ongoing management as a mediator between specialists and patient. 
the clinic my gp works at is in an area where the demographics are majority people of non-english speaking backgrounds with poor health literacy. 
in complex patients such as refugees who have poor understanding of their health, 
it is difficult for them to organise their own appointments and keep up to date with their health. 

taking this barrier to healthcare into account, the clinic has other available healthcare providers on site such as dieticians, psychologists, psychiatrists, diabetic nurse educators and nurses. 
the gp can easily refer to the relevant services for the convenience of the patients whilst also maintaining the continuity of care. 
whilst the referral pathway involves the gp providing referral letters for their patients to access tertiary care (eg, specialists, radiology) and other health services, 
my gp would take it a step further and call on behalf of the patients to set up an appointment for them. 
this evolving referral pathway ensures these patients of disadvantaged backgrounds are accessing such health services.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"interesting to hear both of your thoughts.  
as for me, i'd say the main impact in practice, would be highlighting that for elective cases such as this there needs to be a well set up pathway 
to discuss these patients as a group with appropriate multidisciplinary input from cardiology/cardiothoracics and the primary surgical speciality in particular. 

this is something i would like to make sure exists in any department i work at in the future. 
it was good to consolidate my knowledge in this area and appreciate a greater understanding of the current 
and most recently published evidence showing the ongoing non inferiority of percutaneous valvular intervention, 
which is not yet translated fully into clinical management of this disease process.",1,M,ENGLISH
"the family members of a deceased person, who consented to a body donation, should not have the right to revoke consent. 
this is due to the fact that it was the deceased person's bodies, and not their families. 
i am a firm believer in 'your body, your choice' and i think this rule applies here too. 
i think it becomes especially important when, as an example, the body donor had different beliefs regarding body donation to their family. 
i don't think it would be morally right to take away a deceased person's decision to donate their body to science.

students absolutely have an obligation to protect the privacy of the donors. 
as they are working so intimately with these donations, it is imperative to take extra care to ensure the preserve the privacy of these donors. 
this extends to privacy of the family as well, as this is still their family member. 
with the correct precuations taken, situations like the one in scenario 2, can be avoided. 

i think this should apply to 3d prints and scans of donated bodies as well, as it is still their body, just a replica.
this obligation extends out to photos of donated bodies and parts, as the picture still does depict the donated body.

i mostly agree with dylan here regarding the topic, though i do believe on the social level, lifestyle choices, which sometimes is a factor in whether someone is fertile/infertile, is an aspect we can control and not leave to ""chance"". that being said, couples who are genetically disadvantaged should be given every right to have access to art.

in terms of ethical concerns raised, by using preimplantation genetic screening (pgs) and diagnosis (pgd), it offers the unique ability to characterize the genetic composition of embryos prior to embryo transfer. i believe that such manipulation of the genetic composition of embryos must be held to rigorous public and scientific oversight to ensure that scientific advances are tempered with the best interests of society in mind.

in terms of a finite answer to the question being asked, i agree with dylan that it is sensitive and non-conclusive. art is a field that is dynamic and ever-changing. it is therefore upon experts in the field to continually monitor these art technologies and ensure they are offered in a way that balances patient care with social and moral responsibility.",1,M,ENGLISH
"the most likely diagnosis is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. 
this accounts for her sudden onset pain and easily explains her vaginal bleeding. 
the resulting haemorrhage leads to signs of hypovolemic shock, including paleness and hypotension, all of which are in the presenting case. 

there is also a likely chance of internal bleeding, which could have irritated the phrenic nerve, causing her right shoulder pain. 
it is unlikely to be a peptic ulcer as the pain is specific to burning or gnawing, and also would not explain the vaginal bleeding. 

pain from an appendicitis tends to be central and then moves, typically accompanied by vomiting and other symptoms that are not included here. 
similarly, pancreatitis usually has pain radiating towards the back, instead of non-specific pain. 
gallstones presents with sudden-onset pain, as seen in the case, however tends to be accompanied by jaundice which is not included.",1,F,MANDARIN
"description:
i attended my first bioscience tutorial. 
i got to meet my teachers and peers i will be seeing in the same course. 
this was the only time i attended class before the covid-19 situation happened.

feelings:
at the time, the situation wasn't bad and didn't escalate to a higher stage.. i wasn't worried but was cautioous that it will get worse. 
i felt calm during this time but also excited about studying to become the best nurse i can be. 
i still feel grateful that i can still continue my course without it having been postponed even if the learning experience is not 100% and face to face. 

evaluation: 
i was relieved to have attended at least one class to meet my teacher and peer before quarantine.

analysis:
i know the situation will get worse, so i will need to prepare for the worse and adapt to the changing conditions by changing the way i study and at home. 
a study timetable will help me balance my study and work. 
a study plan will help me approach each subject at the best way i can as each subject has very distintive content.

conclusion: 
all i need to do is stay home, stay focussed, determined to work hard and stay organised. 
i will balance my stidy with work through a study timetable and use my study plan.

action plan: 
familiarise myself with moodle and excecute my study plan everyday and attend my online classes to beocme the best nurse i can become.",0,M,VIETNAMESE

"exactly! what is we usually tend to forget applying ebm, is some of its negative consequences, albeit them being brought upon unintentionally. 

some important aspects of healthcare delivery that carter to individual patients are often ignored. 
examples of such are, the patients depth of understanding and insight towards their own medical conditions 
and the ongoing/upcoming treatment that they will be going through, as well as beliefs (due to either personal/traditional/cultural experiences and background.

this is especially so in the context of an ageing population in the australia society (or other developed nations), 
where an increasing proportion of the population that requires medical care will have multiple comorbidities 
that could present a diverse clinical scenarios, not always explicitly stated in guidelines. 

this is made worse, if the practitioners merely followed the guidelines blindly and avoid using the full extent of their clinical judgement. 
ironically, this will lead to a decrease in care received by patients, which is contrary to the original intent of the evidence-based medicine. 

of course, as you have mentioned, ebm is not perfect, and it is still increasing adapted by most doctors, because it is still better than traditional approach towards management, e.g. eminence-based medicine, etc. 
ultimately the crux should be how health care practitioners can make use of the pros of ebm and individualize and channeling the benefits for the patients.",1,M,"CHINESE, NEC"

thank you for discussing culturally safe practice.  
your writing reinforces my recent learning at qld health mandatory training in aboriginal an torres strait islander cultural practice.  

kinship is at the heart of indigenous society, and there are three levels of kinship in indigenous society: moiety, totem and skin names.  
aboriginal and torres strait culture is fascinating hence my interest in your writing within context of mental health nursing.  
i have always marvelled at the definition of health given by australia's first nations people which we can all learn from in all area's of health care.  
with school nursing for instance, i find that i am often asking young people about their totems which is a strategy to facilitate engagement 
and to develop a therapeutic relationship via their culture (australians together, 2020).  

the 13 year old adolescent male with suicidal ideation and substance use i wrote about proudly stated his totems, 
which are the turtle for his father's clan and the snake for his mother.  
he lit up while speaking about his totems which was wonderful to see.

i also noticed many of the micro skills that were used in the video- i have to admit it gave me flashbacks to the critical 1 assignment where we had to conduct an intake interview in front of the class. 
your summary of the techniques and theories used in the video is really good, the two things that really stood out to me were the social workers' non-judgemental approach and the fact that she did not attempt to tell the client that she should cease contact with the perpetrator. 
i think it is so important to remember that victim/survivors have already lost so much control over their lives, and social workers should never become another mechanism of control by pressuring v/s to take certain actions. 

i also wanted to say thank you to siobhan for filming the video! everyone always says that social work is a 'doing' profession, but it's rare that anyone actually explicitly shows us how to do it. this was a really useful learning activity for me and i'm sure lots of others.

people in my country (philippines) often times ignore the symptoms because accessing healthcare services is considered to be a luxury. although the government of the philippines has its own health insurance scheme, the types of services and the amount covered is very limited. most of the companies provide a benefits scheme for their employees and one of which is getting their employees a private health insurance. however, people who are not employed and are owning less than the minimum wage does not enjoy these privileges.
because of this, they tend to ignore their illness and often times would not buy their maintenance drugs in order to provide food on the table.
however, in 1988, thephilippines enacted republic act no.6675, otherwise known as the generics act of 1988, which sought to promote, require, and ensure the labeling, prescribing, and dispensing of medicines using their generic names which are extremely cheaper than the branded counterpart. (source:https://www.senate.gov.ph/lisdata/57825141!.pdf p1).
there are also multiple diagnostics centre in the philippines that offers lower costs for laboratories (blood works, ecg) encouraging patients to access these services outside the hospital.
in my opinion, educating people about the services they can avail should be prioritised. the government must also act in improving the funding system of the health care services to allow all citizens to access this basic human right. tension between the government and health practitioners must be ceased and they should rather think of how to provide quality care to their people.",1,F,TAGALOG

while prepping the patient for the procedure, the nurses had allowed students to place the oximeter and ecg leads on the patient. 
whilst wrongly placed oximeter and ecg leads are not life-threatening per say, 
it still plays a role in monitoring the patient while ect is being administered. 

as we are students, i felt there should have been checks done to ensure we did it the right way, but no such measures were taken. 
this applies for all procedures students undertake not just the ones mentioned above. 
after the ect procedure was completed, i had brought the issue up with the supervising clinician.

"can a manager be a leader at the same time?
yes.
how are management and leadership functions related?
leadership and management are related, the theories about exactly how have changed with time and fashion.
writings in the 1970s focussed on the differences between managers and leaders, with the resultingview that they are mutually exclusive, due to differences in motivation, personal history, and behaviour (1).
in 1990 kotter took this a step further and stated that managers and leaders actually operated in different spheres in organisations, and that at that particular time, especially in the us, more leadership was required for organisations to be successful, especially during change (2).
managers run large organisations, they set and follow processes to deliver products / outputs from a given set of inputs. in order to do this, they use polc  planning, leading, organisation, and control of resources (3)
modern views on the relationship between leadership and management acknowledge that good management includes leadership.
modern views on leadership, including that of samson, donnet and daft, state that leaders can be present in all layers of an organisation, not just concentrated at the top.leadership can be defined as the ability to influence people towards the attainment of the organisational goal (4).


what challenges might one have in performing the two functions simultaneously?
there are plenty of opportunities in all organisations for managers to inspire and influence their employees in order to lead.
the extent to which this actually happens depends on many factors, which can be divided in those pertaining to the manager, the workforce, the organisation, and the external environment. managers are often so busy and tied up with thecycle of polc that they have little time for reflection and taking a wider or different view from the current status quo.
management skills include technical, conceptual, and human skills. the ability for a manager to lead depends on the extend in which they can inspire their employees to follow them. this requires a perceived proficiency in technical skills, as well the ability to relate, communicate, and make relevant to workers, the organisational vision. this requires the soft human skills related to effective communication.
the workforce also has an effect on the ability of a manager to lead. if it is low-skilled and requires a lot of active management and guidance in order to produce the required output, the manager will have little time to lead. similarly, if the workforce is lacking motivation for whatever reason, leadership will also be difficult.
the organisation itself can also facilitate or obstruct leadership in managers. the culture is important, including factors such as encouragement of leadership at all levels of the organisation, shared vision, and aspirational leadership at the very top.
the type of environment an organisation finds itself in will also affect the ability for managers to affect their leadership skills. a rapidly changing environment, such as the current covid-19 pandemic, means organisations need to make rapid, unprecedented changes to the way they operate. these changes are facilitated better by managers with stronger leadership qualities, those who can inspire the workforce, who are trusted to do the right thing for the greater good, without putting the individual at risk.

thank you for sharing! i agree that with your statement that clinicians should strive to practice ebm while still taking into account a patients preferences and cultural belief. i believe that to deliver the best management may not mean to provide them with the best treatment or medications according to the guideline, rather it is more important to address and reevaluate their concerns, as the saying goes, to cure sometimes to comfort always. it is also interesting to know about the courses and training on ebm available to senior clinicians. i often hear from our tutors on their support towards ebm and how privileged we are to have it integrated into our curriculum.",1,F,HOKKIEN

loving reading everyone's responses and different perspectives on this.
personally i would continue into the bush. while there are dangers present, there isn't much that can be done to reduce them apart from remaining vigilant and keeping an eye on where you're walking and what's ahead
examples of these dangers include
- unstable ground
- tree branches
- animals/insects
i wrote about these more in detail in my notes but seems that copying and pasting it across wouldn't be too useful.
i was also considering: what caused this patient to be 500m away from his vehicle? the vehicle is almost in the middle of the road and just left there, was he chased by or chasing something/someone potentially?
for the patient's management in scenario 1,  i would be fairly confident that an artery has been impacted by this patients laceration, potentially their femoral artery, due to the bright coloured blood and pulsing nature. i would apply pressure asap and dress the wound with a pressure bandage to minimise the blood loss. if the blood continued to seep through, i would repeat the process, attempting to slow the blood loss from the wound. i would then check the distal side of the wound to see that the dressing is not too tight, by checking for capillary restoration and numbness
there appeared to be nothing obvious in the wound so irrigation would not be necessary, since it would take up valuable time where the patient would be bleeding out. i would then immobilise the patient to stop the wound from getting worse. extrication of the patient would then begin.
i would repeat the process for scenario 2,  i would be less suspicious of arterial involvement in the wound due to the colour of the blood and nature at which it is coming out of the wound. i would apply digital pressure and then dress the wound with a dressing and pressure bandage.
scenario 3, well. i wouldnt be mad.. a wooden leg filled with candy? thats amazing!",1,M,ENGLISH
"additionally with reference to covid-19 and kevin's post at pdh we use workplace an app similar to facebook. our head of department has set up a group within workplace for primary care department leadership. this was to pass along any new information and planned operational directives either via memo's or by video.

for instance, the latest was planning code brown preparation specifically to the covid-19 pressures. which included discussing the transition of outpatient and group clinics, non-urgent clinical contact to a telehealth where possible or using other modes of communication with patients. we then disseminate these changes to our relevant staff. this is done via email or workplace as well.

i was a bit hesitant to use instant messaging but the more i have used this mode the more i agree with kevin that it has changed and revolutionised communication processes, much more so that hard copy bulletins or the paging service. we sometimes use hardcopy memo like boards to saturate information if people too busy to check their phones.

however, confidentiality issues, compliance with privacy legislation and institutional policy is a professional and corporate risk as always.

"hi all,
i didnt expect topic in this week would be that heavy and challenging emotionally. but thanks for everyones sharing and i hope we are all travelling well.

frankly, i was shocked about what i read from the textbook, saying when women are targeted for rape in conflict situation, enemy often uses raping women as a way to humiliate and demonstrate power over the men in the community, females are still objection and it is really heartbreaking. those women dont have their say and suffer the impact of trauma, torture, displacement, loss of family dynamic and relationships. at the same time they need to act as a protector not to speak up for themselves but to keep secret for their community or culture. all human beings need social connection and need connect with our own identity, culture and beliefs. when they disclose violence they suffer, it can have a huge change and challenge in their life. another thing is when they lose the agency or their power are taken away for a long time, its understandable that they dont know how to make decision on their own or feel anxious about decision-making. if social workers didnt acknowledge this, it might be easy to take it for granted or think they lack of ability, which may not be the case.

another thing in the reading surprised me is that dv can be viewed less extreme or serious compared to their previous life experiences, such as war, flight and encampment. sometimes, refugee women are expected to be grateful for the safety they experience in countries of resettlement. in that context, refugee women may be worried that disclosing dv could make them seem to be ungrateful or unworthy of asylum in the first place. i havent ever thought about this before since i do believe everyone has the equal right to be safe and free to live, regardless of nationality, race, religion and sexuality etc. any type of harm is unacceptable. those trauma and harm can be accumulative, but not choosing which one is much severer than another one. its crucial to acknowledge their lived experience so that we wont bring our own assumptions and personal judgement into practice.",1,F,MANDARIN

the contention of the article is that pollution licenses are ineffective and licenses need to be stricter to include all pollutants released from any location (wright, 2012). since the 2011 orica event, the nsw has made it mandatory for orica to make all environmental monitoring data available to the public (wright, 2012). 
i can imagine people like nancy, would find this particularly useful. 
this enables transparency between orica, the government and the public and should help build trust and rapport between these stakeholders.

additionally, i would like to add that the conversation lists ian wright, the writer of this article as a lecturer in environmental science at the western sydney university. so i would assume this information is legitimate and not subject to bias.

"if leadership is about empowering and motivating people toward achieving a goal, and management is more about the acquisition of that goal through planning, 
organisation and utilisation of resources, i can see that it may be potentially be difficult to perform both functions in the same moment. 
it seems to me that leadership calls people to almost transcend their usual activity whilst management may tend to reinforce it. 
the theoretical action of both simultaneously could be presented as paradoxical, though in practice i dont see them as a true dichotomy.

it is my assertion that a single person can function as both leader and manager, though perhaps it is difficult to manifest both offices at the same instant in time. 
however, a leader can swing into managing a team to achieve the articulated goal just as a manager can take the lead to inspire 
and motivate a team to go about their efforts with renewed purpose and vigour.

in my experience leadership and management can be at odds with one another, hence it can a difficult task to exercise both simultaneously. 
as a manager i might need to reinforce compliance and adherence to plans, procedures and hierarches, 
whilst as a leader i might instead challenge people to think and work beyond the paradigm of their usual activity. 
these two things can be at times mutually exclusive.

whilst zaleznik [1] asserts that leaders and managers have very distinct personalities and approaches very rarely found in the same person, alvesson &amp; blum [2]allow for greater overlap between the two. they accept that the roles are very different but present that one person can very effectively use both approaches in different instances to achieve their goals. i think i am more inclined to believe the latter, though can accept that it might take a person to act out of suit, or against their natural inclination, to have to do so. personally i find i am a far better leader than manager, but can play the role of manager when that is required of me, albeit with more effort and perhaps less effect than someone more gifted as a manager.

"primary prevention
example 1:anti-smoking advertisements
this is an example of primary prevention because these campaigns are focusing on discouraging smoking from the offset, and therefore preventing the development of smoking related diseases such as lung cancer.

example 2:vaccinations
vaccinations reflect primary prevention as they stop the development of certain sicknesses such as influenza, therefore, meaning that it has eliminated the risk of contamination.

example 3:drink driving laws
this also demonstrates primary prevention as this law eliminates the chance of accidents happening due to drink driving as they would not be behind the wheel, consequently preventing injury.


secondary prevention
example 1:breast screenings
this is an example of secondary prevention as breast screenings for cancer can allow for the early detection of cancer and therefore action can be taken to not allow the disease to progress any further.

example 2:specified diet programs
these programs are an example of secondary prevention as they can help to manage weight levels, which therefore can prevent further heart attacks or strokes of overweight people.

example 3:blood sugar testing
by having regular blood sugar testing it can allow the early diagnosis of diabetes which means medication can be taken to try to decrease the risk of it worsening, meaning it is secondary prevention.


tertiary prevention:
example 1:rehabilitation
group support of similar experiences regarding a disease or illness can help those to rehabilitate and therefore not contribute to developing issues as a result of that ongoing disease or illness.

example 2:support groups
this is an example of tertiary prevention as support groups can help those with diseases such as cancer to find people going through the same thing and prevent the development of depression as they are not alone.

example 3:medicine to prevent seizures for those with epilepsy
those with epilepsy can take medicine to try to decrease seizures which can help to manage the consequences of their ongoing medical condition, meaning this is an example of tertiary prevention.",1,F,ENGLISH

one of the things we discussed was the lack of recording during health crisis such as pandemics. 
there is limited literature regarding the current pandemic of covid-19 in regards to clear numbers of cases 
and contraction through hospital stays as there are not screening tests available to all. 

worldwide there are different levels of testing available, and, as the pandemic began in china, some information regarding its transmissions between patients within hospital, is not available. in australia, hospitals are to test people if they have a temperature of 38 degrees, with acute resp distress plus they have been overseas in the last 14 days or they have been in contact with someone who has a confirmed case. 
having just respiratory symptoms with a fever is not enough. 
however in places such as america, their president has declared testing is available to anybody. 
this vast discrepancy between countries' collection of data will not only produce unreliable data, in americas case, 
it decreases their ability to test people and trace back to the source in a timely fashion.
this inability to collect reliable data across countries will result in the inability to reflect, 
after the pandemic, on which countries developed the most effective coping mechanism with the virus.",1,F,ENGLISH

3. how does culture influence communication about dying, choice of palliative care, and the use of advanced care planning?western-based medical approach may be in conflict with cultures or health norms of cald communities, leading to misunderstanding and health disparities, and finally miscommunication, inappropriate care treatment and poor death for the patients.

5. how can health care professionals (nurses and midwives in particular) be culturally responsive to support cald people who are ageing and dying?nurses should be culturally sensitive that being aware of the cultural differences from cald people and identify their special needs related to ageing and dying. moreover, effective communication is essential to build rapport between nurses and patients and their relatives. health information regarding medication and treatment options should be delivered in a culturally appropriate manner, so that they and their families can understand. for example, offering interpretation service if required or using their languages for information delivery.",1,F,CANTONESE

evidence based medicine is one part of this solution. evidence based medicine is a decision support tool not a decision making tool. each individual patient requires individual consideration of the evidence and we cannot expect the evidence to do this for us.

"hi everyone, 
my name is sachini and i am a 2nd year biomedical and engineering student. 
after graduation, i would hope to either continue my studies in post grad dentistry or work in the biomedical engineering field. 
working from home is new but also a difficult experience for me, especially when i always studied in biomed building last year and barely at home. 
i am really hoping this will be over soon because being stuck at home is more stressful than i thought it would be. 

my discussion topic: should infertile couples be permitted to use donor eggs/sperm and surrogacy?
gametes donation and surrogacy is a common but also a controversial option for couples trying for a baby. 
these methods are quite different to other options such as ivf and other use of assisted reproductive technologies as more than 2 people/parents are needed in order for the child to be conceived. these ways also require legal assistance and could be a long process. 
however, it should be considered under extreme circumstances where art is no longer an option such as the parents not having enough gametes for reproduction 
or issues with the womb of the maternal parent where surrogacy have to be considered. 

i personally believe that the sperm/egg donors should have rights for the child to a certain extent. 
for example, the donor should have the right to be in touch with the child if they prefer but should not have custodial rights unless both parents of the child are passed away. surrogates may have even less rights as the child barely have any biological connections with surrogates. 
however, during the time of surrogacy, the surrogate should get greater rights in comparison to the parents when making decisions such as doctors visits, diets and exercise. 
the parents should be obliged to respect and take care of the surrogate parent during pregnancy and birth and maybe even some months after.",1,F,SINHALESE

"really great points, liezel! i agree, they can be time consuming, difficult to complete, and too long which can make the information gathered not as beneficial as the answers get lost or become confusing. potentially a multi-rater feedback tool with a select few questions rather than a resource like the one i mentioned, would be a more beneficial way of gaining feedback in order to develop self-awareness. i also don't believe that generic questions with likert scales like the example you've put above (which i too have seen before!) would be overly helpful in significantly improving self awareness, when compared with an open ended question. thank you for making me think about this more critically!!
with regards to your query about bias and your example of how different people might answer a question... i actually don't think that is a bad thing as this reflects how the person is perceived by different colleagues / subordinates and we know that there are a diverse range of people working in healthcare from diverse backgrounds. i think the example of the nurse educator's teaching style being perceived as 'unhelpful' by international students in chapter 5 of our text book is a good example of how different people perceive others and how we need to work to adapt and be flexible in our environment to be effective in our teams.

"learning about evolutionary psychology and behavioural genes has only confirmed things i'd heard in the past about learning before birth. reactions that are paired with emotions such as aggression or anxiety must be stored in the nervous system, which no doubt could be transferred through multiple generations. i'm a living example of pre-learnt taste buds, but i would like to know if playing classical music to a baby in the womb really does increase it's intelligence and brain development!?",1,F,ENGLISH

"what challenges do you see in developing a more distributed approach to leadership in your own work setting?
the distributed approach to leadership flys in the face of traditional hierarchical culture and structure of health care, as discussed by gordon et al when they set out to explore the experiences of medical trainees and leadership in the workplace(1).
traditionally doctors and specialists sit at the top of the hospital hierarchy. i think the distributed approach to leadership is made easier in our organisation as our doctors are visiting medical officers (vmos) from local private practice. this unique circumstance deviates from the traditional model of hospital hierarchy, as the hospital leadership responsibilities fall to the senior nurses.
in my role as health services manager (hsm), i encourage the clinical staff to take on more responsibility and leadership in their roles. when i commenced as the hsm, i was replacing someone who had an autocratic style of leadership, who tended to micromanage staff. the culture was one of blame and shame. this leadership style disempowered and eroded the confidence of the most senior nurses and vmos.
my goal has been to try and build trust and confidence amongst the team. encouraging staff to feel confident and empowered to work at the top of their license, to embrace change, and let go of the concepts of the past. because of the previous leadership style, the staff consisted of traditionalists (laggards), who feared change.the main challenge i have discovered is the effects of poor leadership can take years to reverse.
i have taken great inspiration from week 10 reading, institute of health and improvements psychology of change framework to advance and sustain improvement (2). i particularly like the concept of power being the ability to act with purpose; and the need for courage, the emotional resources to choose to act in the face of difficulty or uncertainty. (2) this framework for change and successful implementation really resonates with me and will become the framework i use for future implementation projects.
the challenge is to empower staff to feel they can take a risk, they may perceive goes against the grain of the organisation, to result in the mindful choice to act(2) to implement change when and where it is necessary. as helen bevan discussed in her podcast, implementation is most successful when there is a social connection to a problem, staff can act quickly and feel it is 'safe to fail', the impetus is on trying to implement a solution, learning as much from your failure as you do from your successes.

"breast cancer is the second largest cause of cancer death in australian women (1) with one in 8 australian women developing breast cancer in their lifetime (2). having regular mammograms can help detect breast cancer early and improve chance of survival (2).a mammogram is an x-ray of breast tissue that can find changes too small to be felt during a physical exam and is recommended for all women aged 50-74, provided they have been informed of the risks and benefits (3).a review of the 2009 breastscreen australia program indicated a reduction in breast cancer mortality for the age group of 50-69 years of approximately 21-28%, with subsequent studies estimating a mortality reduction benefit of between 34-50% (3).
while the benefits of screening mammography are outlined, there are also the risks of overdiagnosis which may lead to unnecessary treatment. overdiagnosis is stated as being a substantial problem that requires urgent changes in public health policy (6) and one that is recognised as the most serious down side of population breast screening (4).
overdiagnosis refers to screen-detected malignancy that would not have progressed to clinical or symptomatic presentation during the individuals lifetime and would have not been diagnosed nor caused the individual any harm in the absence of screening (4).false positive recall, leading to unnecessary testing and biopsy is the most frequent outcome of mammography screening (4) with false positive recall being shown to cause undue anxiety in affected women (4).
a major issue with mammography screening programs is that the x-ray technology cannot distinguish between fatal and harmless breast cancer (5). breastscreen australia identifies that for every 1000 women screened, 45 will be called back for further tests, of which 6 will be identified as having breast cancer (2).
further research into limiting overdiagnosis in breast screening should be implemented. a complementary solution could include more accurate testing to identify only clinically important cancers, or a least correctly identify low risk cancers as such (6). currently, once breast cancer is shown during screening, treatment is recommended as current knowledge cannot identify which breast cancers will be harmful and will progress if untreated and which breast cancers may not be harmful (4).whilst the concept of overdiagnosis can not be diminished, early diagnosis has been shown to improve breast cancer survival rates, minimise invasive treatment and provide women with more treatment choices (2).

"hi peter, thank you for an interesting post. 
i think msds are particularly helpful in medical cases where the knowledge of occupational exposures to causative agents can alter therapeutic management. i came across an interesting study where msds helped to save a young lady. she was a laboratory worker in a meat processing plant who was in a coma and had been diagnosed with acute hepatitis which required liver transplantation. in this particular case, a  further history and a review of  her workplace's chemical inventory and material safety data sheets (msds) displayed that the patient's acute hepatitis was caused by exposure to chloroform in the laboratory. she had been exposed to to chloroform at a concentration of more than 15 ppm for 2 weeks. this significantly changed the management of the case, as most chemically induced hepatic failures are self-limiting in nature and often subside if exposure is discontinued. if the msds had not been reviewed, the patient would have to receive a liver transplant with its risk of complications and the consequent need to take immunosuppressive medications for the rest of her life. this clearly demonstrates why a review of occupational history is important.

"hi everyone,
really great to put faces to some names today in our first lecture!
i live in port melbourne (for anyone familiar, about a block from where the spirit of tasmania ship docks). 
lockdown has been a little challenging because i had to quarantine for two weeks upon return from my honeymoon at the end of march - though i am so so lucky that my wedding and honeymoon could happen at all! isolation is much easier than quarantine though, and bringing my dogs to the beach and rollerblading with them in tow is my favourite activity of the day!! i also love to sew, paint and woodwork so i am pretty happy keeping busy with my hobbies. 
in terms of work, i am in management consulting and our setup is pretty flexible, to begin with, so using skype to connect with clients instead of face to face has been the only real adjustment for me. 
@allan - what type of consulting do you do?
really excited about this course and looking forward to studying with you all!

"hi nayana,
reading this anecdote served as a reminder of the potential impact that many seemingly small decisions/actions made by healthcare professionals can have on a patient's life. from my understanding the most likely mechanism for this to have occurred is a clerical error, either by the teams documenting her request not to receive endone or by the prescribing team failing to witness her past addiction and requested abstinence. i'm sure many details of varying significance are missed constantly during note-taking and handovers, but this anecdote serves as a reminder of our responsibility to be as thorough as we possibly can in our (future) work, as the ramifications have the potential to be dire.",1,M,ENGLISH

most recently i have found the bullet journaling method a good way to keep my tasks in order and provide myself a timeline and accountability to complete them by a set date. bullet journaling also allows me appropriate flexibility in readjusting and ""migrating"" tasks to a different time as needed. i find this works well with my 'organisational' structure and is something that i can actually stick with.
the gantt chart is a very 'type a' system in my opinion. i can appreciate the satisfying nature of its systematic approach. everything is visible and in a structured chronological order. this does not really work for me personally; i find myself lost in the process and overloaded with information packed so densely into a timeline. for this reason i don't think the gantt method is appropriate for me personally, but definitely recognise it's value for someone who can actively work within its structure.",1,M,ENGLISH
"ottawa charter 
build health policy
an increase in the prevalence of fires, thus increases the smoke around australia. this can force the ability for the government to build policies with rules and regulations regarding allowance and occurrence for fires. for example, the use of fire pits in the home and social use of bonfires.
create supportive environments 
this would be best be achieved through support of members of the community supporting one another in especially hard times. this could be done through education programs on fire safety and the importance of it. by each community members having the knowledge of this, it could possibly decrease fire activity and risk.
strengthen community action develop personal skills 
community action could be strengthened by fundraising and/or charity events aimed to support those who have the most by the fires. also, the possibility for easily accessible healthcare services to those in need, for instance, asthmatics and chronic illnesses.
reorient health services
in order for health-related services to function successfully, there is a need for communication and teamwork with all parties. a further study into the cause and effect of smoke inhalation on illness and disease would increase the knowledge of the dangers of fires.

bangkok charter 
advocate for health based on human rights and solidarity 
advocating for health based on human rights does not apply to the bush fire situations, due to the natural disaster not impacting on human rights.
invest in sustainable policies 
developing programs and policies could reduce the chance of australia facing this situation again in the future would improve the overall wellbeing of australians and target reducing the number of cases related to the bushfires.
build capacity
similar to the ottawa charter, the best chance at building capacity is by educating the population about fire dangers and provide advice about the best protection from hazards involved with smoke inhalation.
regulate and legislate 
also similar to the ottawa charter, creation of policies and regulations would be the same best possible way to build effective legislation around fire use in australia.

this could be achieved by ensuring that all organisations and governments work united to promote the health benefiting policies and procedures.",1,F,ENGLISH

"health promotion and preventive health campaigns tend to push the responsibility for our health into our own hands. objectively, telling people to stop smoking, lose weight, drink less and exercise more are the most cost-effective ways to spend the healthcare budget. however, i think it is unfair to hold everyone completely responsible for their own health, as health is influenced by many things apart from personal choice.i think it is important to acknowledge that people are brought into this world under vastly different circumstances which they have no control over, and this in turn affects their decisions in life and affects their health.
poverty is the largest determinant of health, and is a cycle which tends to perpetuate through many generations. in a society with large disparities in wealth and status between certain groups of people, it is likely that institutional barriers are preventing those of lower socioeconomic status from achieving the same amount of wealth and success as their higher socioeconomic counterparts. the same social structures which privilege some groups of society would disadvantage many other groups, through no fault of their own. this places the burden of disease disproportionately on such disadvantaged groups. arguably, it would then make sense for the responsibility to lie with the public health system, to serve these populations which have been unfairly disadvantaged.
hence, although it may seem that the wealthy contribute more to the public healthcare system while the poor tend to access it more heavily, i think it is important to recognise the underlying social factors behind health and wealth distribution in society.",1,F,JAPANESE

"i believe that the paramedics should have attempted to rationalise with the husband as they have a duty of care to his wife. i think refusal to enter/treat his wife isn't enough of a danger for the paramedics to leave the patient, if he became aggressive or abusive i would agree that the paramedics did the right thing in leaving. they could have suggested making sure the husband was in the room at all times, or guided him through what they would be doing to ensure his wife was okay, such as explaining that they would be taking her observations etc. the crew could have requested a female crew/single responder to dispatch if available, or stayed on scene with the patient and her husband until other help could arrive in case of complications. 
i believe they should be informed of different pathways they can use next time they come across a situation where they are refused by a patient/bystander. the paramedics should have referred them to a nurse-on-call, locum, midwife or to self present at an ed if a female crew was unavailable. 
the paramedics shouldn't lose their registration as they are able to reason that their safety was a priority, but i still argue that they were negligent in providing the best care available as pregnant patients can be dynamic and complications can arise quickly. they should maybe revisit dangers at branch with other paramedics, c/is or team managers to gain an understanding of all the options they had, and to be mindful of cultural barriers they may encounter in the future.",1,F,ENGLISH

in my opinion, the key issue with this process was the lack of attendance of all team members at any one meeting. without having all team members present, the aspect of facilitating shared leadership, where the leader from each profession could provide their expertise, was not accomplished. (2) it is likely that given the number of meetings required to complete the redesign, different team members were identifying different problems at different times. (1) this may be due to factors such as their professional background, experience, priorities and or level of engagement in the redesign at particular times. 
finding a meeting time that works for all team members in healthcare is difficult and at times impossible. this is reality. as a leader i would be trying to think outside the box to facilitate interprofessional practice. i would consider videoconference or circulating an email with key discussion points with clear deadlines for feedback. i would look at my leadership style. perhaps i need to be more transformational and inspiring in order for the team members to engage and prioritise this meeting. whilst these options arent optimal, it should still allow for use of the interprofessional team leader framework.

"hi group 10,
i hope everyones enjoying their placements so far. this past week ive been on my paediatrics emergency department rotation at mmc, where teamwork plays a very important role in patient care.
in the ed, patients present to the triage desk where they are initially seen by a triage nurse who categorises the severity of their presenting complaint based on a short history and examination combined with the general appearance of the patient and their vital signs. from here, the patient is either sent to a cubicle or to wait in the waiting room based on how ill/injured they are. once seen by the triage nurses, the patients are in the emr system, where doctors who have space to pick up another patient can read the brief notes taken by the triage nurse and/or the nurses in the ed (depending on how long the patient has been waiting), and decide based on the patients triage category and the time they have spent waiting who to see next.
after the emergency doctor has seen and assessed the patient, a variety of other doctors may be involved in their care, including pathologists, radiologists, and specialists who may either just offer consults or may admit the patient. in addition, various other staff work to keep the patients well, including bedside and pathology nurses, radiographers, various allied health professionals, cleaning staff, and catering staff.
generally, the clinicians i spoke to agreed that this process worked well, and the only significant issues were encountered when patients werent triaged correctly, especially if a patient was categorised as less urgent than they actually were. i would also agree that this is the main factor influencing the adequacy of teamwork and smoothly running the patient flow through the ed.",1,F,ENGLISH

"nothing brings the issue of clinical governance and corporate governance having conflicting objectives and priorities to light more than the issues that have plagued australia through the hearings of the aged care royal commission.
it is somewhat easy to understand why issues can emerge, with the differences in focus that clinical and corporate governance boards have, these being quality and safety compared to organisational performance. these are somewhat linked but also improving quality and safety can have a significant cost if major flaws are identified.
a key example of this is at the south hobart aged care facility, where internal audits and a whistle-blower doctor raised the issue of nursing staff being cut because the larger business was facing financial difficulties. ultimately everything was about improving profitability and not about patient care. when team members brought issues such as the deterioration of clinical care up with members of the operations team/management they were ostracised. additionally they were using a paper based management system, and lacking nursing staff.
when this was brought up as a red risk to specific areas of compliance upon annual audits the management attempted to rectify the situation by flying in nurses from new zealand for shifts, paying care managers 30% more than on mainland and using agency resources. these changes worked and they passed accreditation but then it was back to putting profits before people and cutting costs rather than caring for patients.
if i was the ceo it would be important to understand the vision and strategy of both the clinical governance and corporate governance boards. listening and understanding where these both align and disagree are essential to solving this crisis. additionally, i would reflect that the vision of the organisation is a patient-centric one, where ultimately if we care for patients better then there will be more demand for our services and thus profitability. i would also speak to staff to understand their perspective of what is working and what is not working. finally, i would look at data such as patient flow, shift times, errors and risks, and bed capacity to understand the business and where there are areas for improvement.

"dysfunctional' mental health system needs boost in wake of pandemic: experts (https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/dysfunctional-mental-health-system-needs-boost-in-wake-of-pandemic-experts-20200514-p54t2k.html)
summary:
experts predict a 30% spike in mental illness during the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, however the current mental health system is ill-equipped to respond to this. there have therefore been calls for a boost to australias already-overwhelmed mental health services, such as by contracting private hospitals to deliver services to public patients.
my view:
mental health disorders have always been highly stigmatised in society. traditionally, a much smaller proportion of the budget is allocated to mental health, as compared to other aspects of healthcare. it is therefore unsurprising that the current mental health system is inadequate in responding to a spike in cases due to the coronavirus pandemic.
the mental health repercussions of covid-19 are real and significant. depression and anxiety are on the rise due to fear and loneliness. job losses and financial instability are other complications which may give rise to mental health disorders [1]. if these people are not well supported by mental health professionals, there is a significant risk of self-harm, aggression or violence towards others, or even suicide.
i therefore completely agree that mental health services in australia deserve a much-needed financial boost from the government. other initiatives such as roping in private hospitals to deliver services to public patients would also greatly aid in the response to the mental health crisis. this is because there is a significant number of patients who do not have private health insurance yet are unable to get treatment in the public health system. furthermore, currently most mental health patients have to present to the emergency department to receive treatment. strengthening community mental health services such as by providing more gps with mental health training and certification, would also greatly reduce to load on public hospitals. in my opinion, the added investment into mental health should ideally not be a once-off initiative, but instead a sustained effort into the future, to enhance support for mental health patients in australia.
interest groups:
australian federal government
individual state governments
mental health council of australia
the royal australian and new zealand college of psychiatrists (ranzcp)
racgp - the royal australian college of general practitioners
not-for-profit mental health organisations eg beyond blue
mental health research institutes eg black dog institute
mental health patients
who initiated the story
the story was probably initiated by advisory bodies in parliament, as well as mental health activists, such as the ranzcp, mental health organisations and research institutes. the stigma associated with mental health has always been a contentious issue, as many feel that mental health has not been accorded the same priority, as compared to the other medical specialties. this is therefore a good opportunity for mental health activitsts to push for greater emphasis to be placed on mental health services in australia.

"hi tatiana,
i enjoyed reading about your post about the national tobacco strategy. i do agree upon the goals of the plan to reduce tobacco usage to reduce the burden on copd and lung cancer upon australians, as tobacco usage accounted for 9.3% of preventable burden of disease in the governments 2015 burden of disease report.(1) tobacco usage also accounted for 13% of deaths and 14% of fatal burden in that same study.(1)
chronic diseases that are attributable to tobacco usage, such as copd and chronic bronchitis, also causes further complications and increases the risks of impairing the pulmonary immune response. smoke particles that enter the lung impairs the mucosal membranes function to produce and replace mucus that lines the cilia, leading to build-up of mucus and thus increases infection from bacterial or viral pathogens.(2) the smoke also irritates bronchioles to provoke additional inflammatory responses, leading to a hyperactive immune system.(3)
it is thus important that the national tobacco strategy, as you have mentioned, should be tweaked to provide additional support in targeting the socially disadvantaged, as in 2018, 21.7% of daily smokers resided within the most disadvantaged sectors.(4) allowing programs to quit tobacco would aid in reducing the burden of disease for not only respiratory diseases, but also other chronic diseases as well.

"hi jayashree,
thank you for this interesting post. 
through undertaking my own research on this topic, i found that the ethics in various countries are affected by the cultural, social and economic conditions in these areas. there are also fundamental differences in philosophical views such as the individuality centred views in the western world. [1,2]
i also found this interesting article that highlighted the ethical challenges that occurred in trials that research refugee-background youth. this is due to the power disparity between the researcher and participants, which can lead to issues such as obtaining informed consent from a populace with low literacy rates or those that are hesitant to sign documents. there is also the issue of participants not being familiar with the research process.  in order to overcome this, methods such as obtaining informed consent at more than one stage need to be used. [3]
in order to standardize guidelines globally, specific guidelines centred around the principles of autonomy, maleficence, beneficence and justice. [4] this will decrease the variability of ethical practice around the, as currently the values ones that are constant i ethical research in all countries are respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

"i like the spider web metaphor for the gps role in a healthcare setting that natalie has presented above, the gp at my practice definitely described himself similarly, suggesting that gp's are the centre of a complex network of healthcare. however, he expanded on the importance of choosing the right strand of the web for an individual patient. 
gps are the centre of a very complex network of specialties and subspecialties and are the patients first point of call to enter into this network. a gp must identify the patients key problems to be addressed, identify potential solutions to these problems and refer to specialists which can address these problems appropriately, affordably and in a time-effective manner. its also the gps responsibility to identify what logistical challenges a patient may experience when being referred to specialists: 
-a patient who prefers not to travel should be referred as close as possible
-a patient who is on a health care card and struggling financially should be referred to someone who bulk bills/has low fees
-a patient who is anxious and worried about their symptoms should be referred privately so they see someone as soon as possible. 
with the rise in the number of both specialists and subspecialists available, these factors are important for a gp to consider to ensure the appropriate person within a group of specialists is chosen.  the gp at my clinical practice also reiterated that if you chose inappropriately, and a patient has a bad experience, it may disrupt your relationship with that patient as their gp and it may result in them disengaging with the healthcare system. this is a significant challenge in his practice as he finds the communication style of some specialists is disliked by many of his patients.  
my gp also discussed the fact that when he first started practising, referrals were a linear process. the gp referred to the only neurologist in the area, without consideration of anything other than the medical requirements of a referral. these other considerations became increasingly important as the number of clinicians in a speciality were available. 
at my practice, we managed a patient who had uncontrolled diabetes exacerbated by depression. the challenge with this patient was that they had felt shamed by the previous endocrinologist they had seen, leading them to disengage with screening, medications and lifestyle changes which will improve their morbidity and mortality. this demonstrated the importance of the gp as the first point of call to educate on the severity of illness, and to re-engage individuals with the healthcare system. 
referrals made for this patient: 
diabetes: endocrinologist 
lifestyle: dietician, physiotherapist 
complications: optometrist, podiatrist, renal physician
depression: psychologist, diabetes support group",1,F,ENGLISH

"two key concepts of comparative effective research (cer) are that it should (i) compare two or more alternative tests, therapies or procedures and (ii) be conducted in persons, clinical settings and conditions that are representative of the real world. the goal of cer is to provide evidence for clinicians, patients, policy makers and others to make informed decisions that will ultimately improve the overall health of specific subgroups and of the population as a whole (1)
patients with ckd and esrd are among those with the highest risk for adverse outcomes, with a risk of death rivaling that of patients with metastatic cancer or advanced heart failure. yet, patients with ckd and esrd are frequently excluded from rcts, and observational studies may not always have sufficient numbers of patients with ckd to allow for meaningful analysis in these subgroups (1) (2) (3).
it is imperative to set cer priorities within nephrology in a broad and coordinated effort and to conduct focused high-quality cer to fill in the evidence gaps in areas needed to inform policy recommendations, clinical guidelines or treatment choices. the ultimate goal is to provide efficient and effective health care that improves the lives of patients with ckd.

however, if such a large number of people became sick, they would look for a similar risk factor in all the patients - the water source and most likely link the illnesses to the same sources, making the river and everything that contaminated it its fault. this would be a hard case to solve and probably bring up a lot more ethical issues.",1,F,ENGLISH

"the article
chalns article (1) burnout syndrome among critical care professionals: a cause for alarm, discusses the high rates of burnout in intensive care units. the burnout is described as result of the nature of the work, increased hours, moral distress regarding end of life decisions as well as compassion fatigue.
the result of this burnout is staff being detached in their work. additionally, there is concern about staff mental health.
motivation theory
based on the information from the article and according to maslows hierarchy of needs, the staffs emotional safety needs could be compromised. (2) based on maslows theory, as their emotional safety has not been satisfied, this could explain the disengagement and not seeking to fulfil their belonginess needs within the work community. (1, 2)
communication and conflict resolution strategies
the conflict in this circumstance appears to be surrounding working relationships and the environment. the role each person undertakes in icu in important, i believe the conflict management should be collaborating, where all parties win and an arrangement is reached to increase morale and engagement in the workplace. (3) while this method takes longer, it will result in a better outcome, which ideally will minimise risk of attrition of staff.
as this is non-routine communication and the ideal medium of communication is rich such as face to face. (4) this style of communication will allow both parties the opportunity to assess non-verbal cues and allow for feedback. (4)
job redesign 
when considering the options for job design in the icu setting, many are not applicable such as job simplification and job enlargement. (5) job rotation may be applicable to a degree such as rotating the patient allocation if possible. job enrichment appears to be the most achievable in this setting. management (and colleagues) could promote a setting which recognition and opportunities for growth are considered standard practice. (5)
like job redesign, rewards for motivation in the hospital setting arent always applicable, however options surrounding paid annual leave, considerations with rostering and ensuring annual leave/ado are taken regularly are achievable. (5)
a colleague once told me to punctuate the year with annual leave and i think it a great work/life balance approach!

"i will be discussing an example of harm caused by clinical care that i have observed back when i was doing a general medicine elective in a singaporean hospital. a patient was admitted to a private hospital for an emergent surgery for cauda equina. pre surgery ct scans showed that there were possible perispinal abscesses found, and best practice would advice that these abscesses be drained before proceeding with surgery. however, the surgeon went ahead with the surgery which resulted in complications of bacterial translocation and eventual encephalitis. the patient was then admitted to a public hospital for management of these complications. many of the doctors of her treatment team felt that the treatment she received was questionable and worth reporting. the team attempted to contact the surgeon multiple times but was unable to reach him. they decided to report this matter to their own hospital's management to send the private hospital a formal inquiry. one of the doctors told me that this action was abureaucratic nightmare and can take months to even get a result out of it. this was due to a poor whistleblowing culture within the hospital where the management often delays reviewing reports and efforts to evaluate and monitor the implementation of the remedial action. this was a finding that was similarly reflected in the nswhccc inquiry into campbelltown and camden hospitals in the macarthur health service, where there is often lack of resolve my management to pursue issues raised by whistleblowers (1).
this finding is probably due to the poor culture of whistleblowing within the medical profession where little emphasis is placed on calling out questionable practices of our colleagues. this can be due to fear of being sued in turn for defamation should the other party be proved innocent, or dysfunctional leadership and management which has led to staff seeking change becoming ostracised and ignored. there are many organisational, cultural and policy barriers to overcome should we want to promote a positive culture of whistleblowing in the medical profession.

"hello marcus,
your opinion on the role of guidelines is certainly one that i strongly agree with. it is indeed that clinical guidelines act and serve as structure or framework for the treatment decisions. these clinical guidelines are based of evidence-based medicine which creates a stepwise treatment protocol to create a smooth transition in delivering therapeutic services with the least number of complications.
however, it is indeed that the clinical practice guidelines is just a general guideline.  being a medical student over here in malaysia, i have witness countless of periods where the consultant in charge deviates away from the clinical practice guidelines and uses his clinical expertise for the treatment of choice. when approached with the clinician on why he would do that, the clinician just said guidelines are just safety handles provided to you in case you dont know what to do. every patient is different and hence requires your clinical judgement and experience.. it was certainly an eye-opening experience as i used to uphold the clinical practice guidelines as like the throne of all therapeutic plans.

""a new product is like a baby. you can't just bring it into the world and expect it to grow up and be a success. it needs a mother (enthusiasm) to love and keep it going when things get tough. it needs a pediatrician (expert information and technical skills) to solve the problems the mother can't cope with alone. and it needs a father (authority with resources) to feed it an house it. without any of these the baby may still turn out all right, but its chances of survival are a lot lower.""

"i am currently on my inpatient psychiatric rotation.
i spoke with the psychiatrists on the wards about the protocol for prescribing clozapine, which is an anti-psychotic drug reserved for treatment resistant schizophrenia. clozapine is one of the most effective anti-psychotic drugs, but there are many side effects associated with it, such as neutropenia, agranulocytosis and myocarditis. due to the significant risk of these side effects, patients have to follow a rigorous monitoring schedule, where they have to have blood tests and scans done every few days for the initial part of the treatment, and some of these tests would have to be done regularly for the duration that they take clozapine, which can be for many years. the psychiatrist agreed that having a protocol is very useful as it clearly outlines all the tests and scans required, making it relatively straightforward for prescribers to follow through with the steps. it is also extremely important in this case to prevent harm to the patient. however, we discussed that it is also a tricky drug to prescribe due to compliance issues, and often times, it can be difficult for patients with schizophrenia and associated cognitive impairments to keep track of all the tests to go for. hence, it is important that a patient is thoroughly assessed first for suitability and a case manager is assigned to help them keep track of their medical appointments.",1,F,"CHINESE, NFD"

"how do male obstetricians and gynaecologists fit into the health system?

starting my forth year of medical school with obstetrics and gynaecology made me worried how i would fit into this area of care. it seemed to me that all of the contents are all about women and there is no place for men in this specialty. i thought the patients would not be welcoming me as opposed to my female fellows. however, i was not quite right about this. although the majority of the workforce are female, there is a decent proportion of male as shown in figure 1.

figure 1: the number of vocational trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology in australia from 2013  2016(1)

i talked to several male obstetrics and gynecologists as well as male midwifes which gave me an insight into how they fit into model of care that is dominated by women. it comes down to doctor-patient relationship principles which are universal regarding the gender of doctors and patients. the majority of the time women are fine with male healthcare professionals with occasional exception of cultural and religious believes. all the doctors have to think about is to be respectful and aware of the patients' autonomy regardless of their gender. one of the obstetricians told me that ""this specialty (obstetrics and gynaecology) are the most rewarding experiences you will get"".

having learnt that obstetric and gynaecology do have a place for male doctors, my next question is why male trainee number has been reducing gradually. the answer may be the collision of medicine and gender politics in today's world. many experts suggest that gender diversities is important in solving complex problems in the workplace as it increases input from different perspectives. (2) i also agree that having only half of the people in the field would be something we that need to change. this brings me to my last point that maybe it is the time to advocate for male doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology.

q1. would all stages show the presence of amylase activity? would some stages have more or less amylase activity than others? why?

the 3 different stages germination will have different levels of amylase activity due to their differing needs for metabolic activity. the seeds 0 days old (dormant) dont have much metabolic requirements and therefore less of a need for energy-containing molecules (glucose). this would result in a low amylase activity. the seeds at 3 days, however, will have a higher requirement for energy-containing molecules in order to start the initial growth of the plant. this would suggest that the amylase activity would be particularly high at this stage in germination. after a week when the seedlings now have green leaves, containing chlorophyll, meaning they can begin to photosynthesize and produce their own glucose and therefore have less need for amylase activity to break down starch to glucose for metabolism.

q2. what is the reason for using a boiled control in 1.6?

heating the amylase to boiling point will cause the enzyme to denature thus making it inactive. having this control will allow comparisons to be made between active or inactive amylase

q3. do you expect to reach an achromic point for the boiled control? what is the purpose for using the boiled control in this experiment?

i do not expect the boiled control to reach an achromic point as the enzyme would have denatured an therefore would be inactive and incapable of breaking down starch. the control is used to give a comparison between the active and the inactive enzyme. this will then give an indication of what is expected and what isnt.

q4. if an achromic point is reached using the boiled control, how would you use the boiled achromic point value to correct the amylase activity that is calculated for the germinating seeds?

if the achromic point is reached using the boiled control then that means there could be an organic catalyst that isn't affected by heat and performs the same job as amylase in the solution. the rate calculated from the boiled control would be what the rate is due to other factors that isn't the amylase enzyme. it would then be subtracted from the rate of calculated for the germinating seeds in order to get the rate of amylase activity on its own.



q5. determine the activity of amylase in germinating seeds. include all the steps involved in your calculation. show your working in your answer.

mass of barley tissue = 1.22g
achromic point = 10 mins

mass of barley tissue in 1ml = 1.22/(10x5)
      = 0.0244g

mass of starch = 500mg/100ml
      = 5mg

amylase activity (rate) = 5mg/10mins/0.0244g
      = 20.49 mg/min/g


q6. what did you observe in both the control and the experimental tubes for part 3? was this expected? what does the benedict's test confirm for us in this experiment?

the boiled 3 day old germinant amylase reaction mixture and the boiled starch and water only, (contol) both appeared mostly transparent blue which indicates that the majority of the solution didn't contain maltose. however the boiled 3 day old germinant amylase reaction mixture sample showed a little rust red precipitate (ppt) at the bottom which indicates the presence of maltose - has sunk to the bottom as its heavier. this is expected because heating the enzymes would cause most of them to denature and therefore unable to hydrolyse starch to maltose. a reason there could be some maltose even after heating is that some of the enzymes didn't denature due to unequal heat transfer throughout the solution. however in this experiment the left over amylase reaction mixture was used, which means the amylase and starch have been incubating together to achromic point. the product of this is maltose and is the reason there is some rust red ppt formed after performing benedicts test.


q7. complete the following table:
amylase activity (in mg starch hydrolysed/min/g barley tissue)

dormant seeds (0 days old): 0.00
germinants (3 days old): 20.49
seedlings (7 days old): 7.27


q8. compare the observed amylase activity with the predicted amylase activity for each stage of the barley seeds. for each stage, answer the following:

do your observed results match your predicted results?
why/why not?

the stages of germination showed varying levels of amylase activity, as predicted. the dormant seeds (0days old) had the least amylase activity which was expected because there would be little need for metabolic processes. the 3 day old germinating seeds exhibited the most amylase activity which was predicted because their need for energy in order to grow and germinate is larger than the other stages. the final stage of germination (7 day old seedlings) had an amylase activity level that was lower than the germinating seeds but higher than the dormant seeds. this is predicted as the the seedlings have green, chlorophyll containing, leaves which are able to perform photosynthesis and produce their own glucose for energy.

what biological reasons explain why amylase activity would be present/absent or higher/lower than other stages of the barley's germination process?

dormant seeds (0 days old): amylase would be absent as there is no metabolic processes occurring. (in the experiment there was no indication that it was going towards achromic point over the 20mins) 
germinating seeds (3 days old): lots of energy is required for growth. this energy comes from glucose, which is all provided by amylase hydrolyzing starch. so amylase is higher than the rest. 
seedlings (7 days old): the seedlings can photosynthesize meaning they can produced their own energy and have less reliance on energy being supplied from the starch storages. amylase activity is higher than dormant seeds but lower than germinating seeds.




q9. starch and cellulose are both polymers of glucose. why is amylase able to break down starch into maltose, but unable to break down the cellulose in the cell wall into smaller molecules?

starch is a polymer of glucose bonded by alpha 1-4 and alpha 1-6 bonds, whereas cellulose is bonded by beta 1-4 bonds. amylase can only hydrolyse glucose units when they contain alpha 1-4 or alpha 1-6 bonds, as it does not have the correct structure to break a beta 1-4 bond. therefore cellulose cannot be hydrolysed by amylase.

"on reading the case study, an important approach undertaken by crh was to utilise external cooperation for innovation. the multi-faceted nature of crh initiated the organisation to expand its horizon and become more involved in collaborative behaviour. i strongly believe, my organisation would benefit from external cooperation (5). innovation is often regarded to be a capital investment in acquiring a state-of-the-art machine to aid production, but it need not always be the case. innovation can be a simple tweak in the operating process that can have a big impact on the organizations productivity and efficiency in the long run (1).
many recent pieces of evidence suggest that the innovation process is becoming increasingly open, requiring access and combination of knowledge from different departments and sectors (2). in fact, it is generally known that many of the best ideas may come from unexpected sources and contributors that may not always be found within their own walls (2). the complex nature of innovation requires hospitals to tap knowledge from other health services and sector.
innovation is seen because of feedback loops between knowledge producers and users (2). this shift on innovation processes represents an important alternative to traditional research and development (2). indeed, sources of innovation spread from traditional in-house r&amp;d units to wide collaboration networks of hospitals, other health services, universities, and sub-contracted organizations (2).

"the community may be alarmed to learn that a small group of doctors, known to regulators but not to the public, attract half of all official complaints yet are able to continue in practice, often subject only to mild recommendations such as attending a communication skills course. what is your view on this group of doctors? do they feel that the current professional regulation and accountability effectively deal with bad apples? what do you think could be done better?
according to the article, the complaint-prone doctor was more likely to be male and over the age of 35, with plastic surgeons, dermatologists and obstetricians and gynaecologists at heightened risk of recurrent complaints. notably, doctors from some specific specialties were more prone to complaints which may not necessarily be due to the lack of accountability of the doctors themselves, rather, due to the nature of the specialty itself, which governs a higher risk of medico-legal issues. 
i feel that the current professional regulation and accountability effectively deals with bad apples in the best possible way, in which the medical council regulates the conduct and ethics of registered medical practitioners with the power to revoke practioners licences in cases of severe medico-legal issues and negligence. moreover, the legal system through the courts and the health services commissioner are also responsible for the regulation on these doctors accountability and duty of care towards their patients. 
as only 23% of the national sample of complaints were categorised as about communication and 61% was related to clinical care, mild recommendations such as attending a communication skills course to address the patients complaints is not enough. therefore, medical boards should treat complaints as a screening factor prompting closer observation of a doctor's practice before recertifying that doctor as fit to practise, whereby formal appraisal of a doctors management of a patient compared to the clinical practice guidelines and evidence based medicine should be looked into.

"hi devalina,
i agree that an innovation culture can support organisations. innovation can only be achieved if an organisation has a culture that encourages change (1). and to create and sustain culture change is difficult. 
creating and maintaining this type of culture change may require:
	having mechanisms in place that support staff in trying new ideas
	having a flat organisational structure
	providing incentives and rewards
	having managers that are capable of being flexible, will allow their team to take acceptable risks/try new ideas and support staff learning
	having open and transparent communication channels to build trust (2)
i think the innovation framework that you have identified has its merits; it considers the market, the importance of leaders and poses useful questions to consider for those driving innovation (3). but i think it may lack enough acknowledgement of the role of culture and health care staff (not just leaders) in innovation. of course, as a large private entity, it would have a more business focus.

"hi rowan,
i enjoyed reading your reflection some interesting points about the effects of labeling, the role of spirituality in recovery and the use of the biopsychosocial assessment as an important tool in informing our work with consumers.
labeling is an interesting topic as there seems to be a real struggle with consumers wanting to know what is going on with their health, but also not wanting to be confined or boxed into a mental illness category. it does not make it any easier that in order to access ndis funding a person must prove a certain amount of permanency in their mental illness and describe it as a disability. this must be very confronting for individuals seeking support through the ndis to achieve their goals but the language they're having to use to describe themselves is not very congruent with the recovery approach. another inconsistency i noticed was while i was on placement; i shadowed in a mental health unit for two, and at the time i had little to no knowledge of the recovery model. when i reflect back i don''t ever remember once hearing the word recovery. the staff were over run and there was not enough beds to allow for an appropriate length of stay to make a huge impact. there also appeared to be real lacking of supports in the community as consumers i had seen the first day i was in there, were some of the ones that i saw four weeks later when i returned, and i remember this shocked me.
i am enjoying this elective as i feel it is given me more of an understanding of what consumers should expect from social workers. as you said rowan the biopsychosocial assessment is a good starting point. i also utilised the strengths perspective with patients that i met who were going through some mental health issues. though sometimes i feel just adopting an unconditional positive regard, and being there to listen can be effective as any intervention as sometimes people are just so isolated and lonely and are glad for someone to talk to and hear their story.
i also agree that spirituality is important and it can often be overlooked in a clinical setting. there are many great resources out there that i have personally used to help me through some difficult times, and have helped me to build my self esteem. i think it is a universal thing to want to believe that we all have some purpose in life, though sometimes it is hard to identify that especially if you are ill physically or mentally. it is an interesting place as how do we assist consumers to utilize this mode of meaning making without putting our 'two pence' on it. it's all very interesting!",1,F,ENGLISH
"population is considered the largest collection of a similar interest at a given time. sample is a smaller group within a population that can be used to attempt to represent the population.
for example, a study finding the impact of shift work on the health of emergency services workers in australia would refer to the population of all emergency services shift workers in australia. it is not possible to enrol all emergency services workers in australia so a sample of 1000 emergency services workers could be used. 
there are many variables that can affect the bias of the sample, and it is important to assess the value of the sample used to ensure results are representative. ideally, participants would be randomly chosen, however, this might not be possible as you may have to enrol participants who have elected to be involved and therefore may add some bias to the sample. participants would have to be chosen from all emergency services, for example, choosing a sample of 1000 fire fighters to represent the whole population of emergency services workers would have bias as there are many variables and differences between fire fighters and police officers.  a larger sample size and sampling methods can also be used to reduce bias.

i do believe that evidence based medicine forms a vital role for clinical practice going forward however there are a number of issues that need to be addressed that our causing some issues currently.
currently a lot of evidence is being conducted by organisations that have a vested interest in the outcome such as the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. in their studies they are able to define what an illness is an how its outcome can be measured as well as different inclusion and exclusion data. as a result the studies often find a statistically significant outcome that may only result in a marginal or non gain at all in a clinical setting. however these studies are still used to guide policy and guidelines and a lot of money is invested by governments and patients as a result.
secondly, not many studies include the population who have a high prevalence of chronic co-morbidities. given the population of australia is ageing and there is an increasing prevalence of a number of chronic diseases this is a population where evidence is required.

"hi chris,
just following on in regard to the melbourne factory fires in campbellfield, the report said that toxic chemicals may have been dumped within the sinkholes in a property in western victoria. the factory which caught fire reportedly transported their toxic waste in unlicensed trucks which were not authorised to transport dangerous products. it is alleged that the company which housed the fire stockpiled warehouses of toxic waste from various other companies. this amount of toxic stock in rented out warehouses which were not classified as fit to house toxic waste. in addition it is proposed that the company ignored licensing laws and also stored the toxic waste in various suburbs hoarding it in unregulated conditions. it is also noted that some of the drums were unlabelled and again not regulated. after being inspected, the soil appeared to be laced with toxic chemicals from the nearby sinkholes. hence, the unsuitable conditions for the drums were detrimental issues as soil and sanitisation were compromised.

"1.identification number
each identification number should be for only one person. however, in this data table, identification numbers are repeated. hence, we can not identify patients later. to avoid this mistake, we need to regulate on the data entry platform that numbers cannot be repeated and there will be error warning if identification numbers are repeated.
2. date of birth
the date of birth in this table is unstructured. we should regulate one form for the date. for example dd/mmm/yyyy, followed by an example like 01/jan/1970.
although there are different ways to write a date, in my opinion, dd/mmm/yyyy is the best way to write it, to avoid mistakes. for example, if we see a date: 01/02/1970, we can't be sure if it's 01/feb/1970 or 02/jan/1970. i personally suffer this mistake in my previous study and needed to call all the participants to make sure which is the day or month.
also, we should regulate the minimum and maximum year of birth, based on our population age. for example, we recruit patients from 18 to 70 years old. we recruit patients from the year 2020 to 2025. so the date of birth of patients should range from 1950 to 2007 and we can only enter numbers from 1950 to 2007. there will be no mistake like in the last row of this data table, with the year of birth 2961.
3. tumour identification number
i suspect that thetx_id of the first row is mistakenly typed, as it has four digits while in other rows, there are only three digits. to avoid this mistake, we should restrict the tx_id to have three digits only and there should be error warning to let people know and check their data. for example. they want to type 367. but they typed 3467. if the cell in the data entry platform has restricted three digits only, but there is no warning, the data may end up being written as 346.

i agree that good communication is the key in achieving a certain goal as a team. good communication with each team member is crucial for group work so that each individual will understand their roles and responsibilities in achieving the end goal of the project. problems faced by any individual should be discussed together to help each other out to make a certain project a success.",1,F,MANDARIN

my evaluation was pretty much the same. 
didn't find any red flags as all vital signs were normal and he didn't mention any specific conditions. psa, rsa and gcs are all in the normal range.
he does fall under frailty though which warrants a yellow flag but this isn't too serious. he is 'fit and healthy for his age' but has a walking stick and takes crestor so i would say he falls under 'managing well'. 
the ecg was abnormal but that can be due to the fall or his cholesterol (maybe the pills aren't working) 
overall, i might transport him to the hospital if he wishes only because the ecg concerns me and i'm paranoid :( 
but if he vehemently refuses, leaving him at home won't be too bad. like erin said i'd have to instruct the nursing staff to call an ambulance should anything else happen and give them any other relevant information before leaving.",1,F,HINDI

"falls are considered as major public health issue as they are the single most major cause of preventable hospital admissions and falls in hospitals results in poor patient outcomes and can increase the patients readmissions and length of stay in hospitals (slade, carey, hill &amp; morris, 2017)
best approach to decrease falls is assessing patients according to risk factors such as ageing, medications and head to toe assessments. a study model for performance improvement can be implemented and pdsa is one of most effective methods for falls prevention as we can evaluate the effect of interventions.
monitoring tool can be developed of following assessments:
1)     ageing as it increases risk with increase in age
2)     medications such as benzodiazepines, sedatives, diuretics increases risk.
3)     assessment of balance: falls history, gait.
4)     cardiovascular, muscular and cognitive assessments.
once all of these things assessed over the time more patient centric interventions can be placed to reduce number of falls in above categories. it has been seen customised treatment after complete geriatric assessments of components such as age, gate and system assessments decreased 1.5 events per person year when compared to group which doesnt received any intervention(guirguis-blake, michael, perdue, coppola &amp; beil, 2018).

"what do human rights mean to you?
human rights to me mean that every single individual that lives on this earth is entitled to certain rights and beliefs that they should not have to fight or work for, they are owed this because it is the morally right thing to do. to me they mean a fair and equal world where nobody suffers and everybody can receive an opportunity they deserve, where the thought of violence and pain is no longer an option.

describe a scenario (personal or public knowledge) which illustrates a breach in human rights. explain how and why this demonstrates a breach in human rights.your response should be at least 400 words.
the stolen generation
the stolen generation is an example in a breach of human rights here in australia, where between the years of 1910 and 1970 families of the aboriginal and torres strait islander communities were torn apart when the government forcibly removed children from their homes.
the stolen generation was not only a beach of human rights but also morally and ethically wrong in every single aspect and is easily identifiable when looking at the universal declaration of human rights (udhr) that was created to set out a common standard of treatment to all people.

many of the children were placed in institutions where neglect and abuse often occurred which is a violation of the right to freedom of violence and cruel or inhumane treatment or punishment (article 5). in article 12 of the udhr it states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his family or home and should be protected against these interferences, which was one of the main violations as none of this was upheld. there was no logical or adequate reason for the removal of these children from their home as their health and safety was not in question and there was no protection by anyone given to them to uphold their rights. the udhr also states in article 15 that everyone has the right to a nationality and shall not be deprived of it, the stolen generation were specifically targeted for their race and nationality as the government wanted aboriginal and torres strait islander people to essentially be extinct and for the race to die out. it was also enforced that these children were not allowed to speak their native language which suppresses they sense of community and belonging. the violations that took place are all escalated by the fact that is was forced and involuntary by both the children and their families

human rights are meant to uphold equality, freedom, justice and peace among every human being but the stolen generation created the exact opposite of harm, pain, suffering and unjust treatment of others.

"an individuals experience of health is dependent on an array of factors including their social class, education, access to healthcare, occupation and race or ethnicity (arcaya, arcaya &amp; subramanian, 2015).
health inequalities, commonly referred to as health disparities (boston public health commission, n.d.), refer to the systematic differences in measures of health across different population groups (arcaya, arcaya &amp; subramanian, 2015). health inequalities affect vulnerable population groups disproportionately, with socially disadvantaged groups often experiencing poorer health status (liambuttong, 2019). health inequalities can include factors that are intrinsic including an individuals biological determinants such as age and sex. an example of a health inequality is that people with intellectual development disabilities experience higher rates of poor health when compared with the general population (liambuttong, 2019).
avoidable health inequalities are referred to as health inequities; preventable differences between health outcomes that arise from the unjust distribution of health resources (liambuttong, 2019), attributed to the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age (rodriguez, 2017). often labelled as unfair or unjust, these health inequities arise from social injustices (the uneven distribution of benefits and burdens among populations (liambuttong, 2019), are socially produced (boston public health commission, n.d.) and could be reduced through the development of stable government policies and economic arrangements (liambuttong, 2019). an example of a health inequity is that lower-income countries such as chad account for 99% of maternal deaths annually (everts, 2017). another example is that life expectancy varies by 34 years between countries (rodriguez, 2017). such differences in health status could be avoided through stable social and economic conditions and are therefore health inequities (unite for sight, n.d.). to improve health inequity, availability, affordability, acceptability and engagement of services and resources needs to improve, particularly among the disadvantaged community (liambuttong, 2019).

the queensland government has implemented a no jab, no play policy, banning players from competing in the nrl if they refuse to receive their influenza vaccination based on ethical or religious grounds. queensland chief health officer jeannette young has stated that exemptions would only be granted for medical reasons in the same manner that exists for children who are attending child care or for people going to aged care. this policy also extends to interstate nrl players who will be declared ineligible to play in queensland unless they are vaccinated. for a small group of players, this policy has meant that they are unable to return to train or play in the nrl due to their stance against vaccinations.
no jab no pay and no jab no play are health policies that have been implemented for several years by the australian government whereby all children are required to be fully vaccinated to enrol in childcare or kindergarten. its main purpose is to increase vaccination rates amongst young children in the community in order to protect them from acquiring preventable diseases. moreover, under the no jab no pay policy, families are unable to access child care benefits, the child care rebate and family tax benefit a unless their child is fully vaccinated. the only exemption to this rule is if the individual is unable to be fully immunised for medical reasons. these policies act as incentives to increase immunisation rates in order to protect the overall health of both the individual and the wider community.
more recently, the influenza vaccination has become compulsory in many professions, particularly those in the healthcare sector. this is to not only protect the healthcare worker from acquiring a preventable disease, but to reduce the risk of transmission to vulnerable patients such as the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with a chronic disease.
i am in agreement with the current policy being enforced by the queensland government. if players are going to be flying in and out of the state and coming into close contact with other individuals, it is imperative that they are vaccinated against influenza in order to prevent its spread. with the current circumstances surrounding covid-19, the importance of the influenza vaccination has only been further reinforced in order to protect the most vulnerable in society as well as our health system. moreover, as sports players are often seen as role models to many, this policy may encourage other members of society to be vaccinated against influenza. thus, not only do the players themselves stand to gain from this policy, but their families and the wider community as well. the other party to consider in this contentious issue is the minority of anti- vaccinators who will be prevented from training and playing in the nrl unless they act against their beliefs. for many this may not be a feasible option although it must be said that just as other professions are required to receive the influenza vaccination in order to go to work, nrl players should uphold similar standards.",1,F,ENGLISH

"question 7:
outline the possible weather patterns that can affect an aircrafts ability to fly. how do these potentially differ between fixed and rotary wing aircraft?

weather patterns can have a significant impact on the ability of both fixed and rotary aircraft to perform primary and secondary aeromedical retrieval.
clouds
clouds are formed by small water particles that develop into clusters. (1) they create turbulent airflows. (1) the extent of cloud cover determines whether an aircraft can legally fly.
cloud formations, such as cumulonimbus clouds, reduce pilot visibility and can increase the danger to aircraft. (1) certain cloud types can be indicative of dangerous weather conditions that include turbulence, thunderstorms and icing. (1)
cloud cover also reduces visibility and hence increases risk. it is one of the main causes of flight delays and the failure to attend to cases in a timely manner. (2) cloud cover causes a significant risk of an aviation accident and subsequent fatalities and injuries, particularly with rotary-wing aircraft flying in poor visibility. (2) cloud cover causes the loss of visual awareness of landscape and manmade features, particularly during take-off and landing. (2)
ice
icing is caused by the freezing of liquid on the surfaces of the aircraft. (3) the severity of the hazard varies greatly. factors that influence the severity of icing include particle size and concentration, the shape and temperature of the aircrafts surfaces, its speed and atmospheric temperature. (3)
ice changes the dynamics and functions of the wings and controls, particularly the aerofoils. (3) ice also reduce the efficiency of rotor blades. (3) clear ice is particularly dangerous because it coats the wings, blades and tail surfaces unevenly. this creates turbulent airflow, increasing drag and decreasing lift. (3) 
rotary wing aircraft are prohibited from flying in ice conditions due to the dangerous impact of ice on the helicopter performance. (4) fixed-wing aircraft are better able to fly in low icing conditions. ice conditions often lead to a delayed or cancelled aeromedical response for both fixed-wing and rotary aircrafts, potentially affecting patient outcomes. (4)
turbulence
turbulence occurs when the horizontal air flow encounters vertical currents. (5) these vertical currents are created by a number of different factors, particularly where wind speed fluctuates over a short distance.
types of turbulence include: (6)
convective  occurs as a result of cumulative cloud formation from thermal instability where the earths surface has been heated disproportionally.
orographic/mechanical  alterations to wind speed or direction from physical features, such as buildings or mountains, creating eddies. 
frontal  the point at which cold and warm air fronts meet.
wake  turbulence that is generated by other aircraft. for example, a helicopter in a hover motion.
turbulence is hazardous to both the aircraft and its occupants. it can cause structural damage to the aircraft. unsecured occupants can be injured and equipment damaged. (5) turbulence is particularly hazardous to rotary-wing aircraft as they fly at lower altitudes and slower speeds. (7)
thunderstorms
thunderstorms occur when multiple layers of warm moist air rise to the cooler parts of the atmosphere, creating cumulonimbus cloud formations that are unstable with precipitation and lightning. (8) the cool air then drives downwards towards earth, impacting the ground with strong drafts and horizontal winds. (8)
thunderstorms may be occasional and isolated, or embedded in other weather patterns. they cause massive low cloud formations, turbulence, electrical activity, icing conditions, hail and rapid changes in wind strength and direction. (9) thunderstorms are particularly hazardous to both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft, and should be avoided. (9)
the presence of thunderstorms requires careful planning for flights by fixed and rotary aircrafts. it is necessary to know the duration of the thunderstorm and its location. flight plans should provide for a holding pattern or alternate landing place in the event the aircraft is unable to land at its primary location.

i used poiseuille's law here.
i assumed for both situations that the viscosity of the fluid and the length of tube is constant so what i did was made (8nl)/ = constant, so that i can link the two situations together.
so i had (pressure drop x r^4)/(flow rate) = (pressure drop x r^4)/(flow rate) and made the pressure drop on the right side of the equation as the subject, because we have to find that pressure drop.

so instead of getting 39, i got 13 instead.

my name is steph. this is my 2nd subject of the gdp. i learnt a lot through the first, and have been trying my best to reflect on how i can improve in this subject. the most challenging part so far has been adjusting to study in my life. i have 2 young daughters, work part time as a health promoting school nurse, and own a restaurant. so needless to say i am generally pretty busy anyway. luckily i have incredible home support and great kids, so whilst it was challenging i did manage.
i think this time around i am going to focus on effective reading/note taking. look at the assignments/assessment tasks first, and then read in search of back up info to guide the content. also, checking out the marking rubric prior to commencing research reading to ensure that my energy is spend purposefully and with an intent to address the requirements of the assessments. last time, i did lots of reading, lots of note taking but with out specific reference to the assessments ... so whilst it was interesting, not always necessary. and when time is an issue, i feel that it how i can improve for this subject.
also, it felt pretty lonely. online study feels different to my old uni days. i checked these types of boards regularly, but no one really seemed to use them - and i guess i hesitated to use them because they seemed so unattended. the facebook group is handy, but also slightly intimidating - or maybe thats just me getting used to utilising these types of forums to bounce ideas?
anyway, hoping this group might be more engaging in discussions around clarify ideas and expectations of assessments. i will be checking it at least weekly, with the intent to get better at engaging in these types of spaces... so if anyone else is keen to discuss assessments etc. i'll be around.
goodluck.

i expect from this module to gain a better understanding of how to deal with diverse cultures and their cultural beliefs. after gaining some experiences i realized how difficult it can be to work with individuals with a cald background but also when local people are involved. i hope that i can implement the knowledge into my future workplace and therefore prevent any potential misunderstandings.
in nursing school we learnt how important it is to be more sensitive and respectful with other cultures and their background. but knowing how to deal with very intimate and sensitive situations requires in my opinion experience and also being open minded regarding the cultural background of those individuals. during my career as a rn i learnt how kind some colleagues were but i also had some colleagues which were not ready to deal with it. quotes like people need to adjust, when coming into my country seem to be normal and some situations ended in a rather uncomfortable way because they were offended. since also having a cald background i felt sorry for cald individuals but sometimes also for the locals. my parents immigrated from romania to austria shortly after communism fell. i was born and raised in austria but the romanian culture and language was a big part of my life. after graduating from nursing school i went to the capital of austria, to vienna, and worked there as a rn. having your roots from somewhere else helped me a lot at the hospital. i made the experience that people from other countries tended to be more open and sometimes even a bit nicer, perhaps because my roots are also from abroad. i worked together with many physicians and nurses from different countries and i really enjoyed this time. its very refreshing and helps to understand why some people react in a rather uncommon way but also how people show that theyre thankful or even trust you.

"i would add another yes to the topic of discussion. one area that i would want to particularly point out would be the improper handling of excess medications among citizens which results in medication wastage and unnecessary expenditure in national healthcare system. there have been evidences showing that a lot of medication prescribed was unused or expired due to various reasons such as low-adherence, stockpiling, change in treatment regime etc. it came to public health awareness and led to the policy change of monthly prescription refilling scheme to reduce wastage. from my personal standpoint, citizens should play their parts, in tandem with the public health approach, to reduce wastage. one simple way would be handling the extra unused medication over to pharmacy.",1,F,MANDARIN

- the registrar on duty classified her case as mild and didn't prescribe any anti-consultants
- handover to the on-call neurosurgeon was wrong and she was not transferred to the childrens ward as she should have been
- the notes written by the intern during medical rounds were poor and should have be checked over and corrected by the senior medical resident or even by a consultant.
-  due to poor communication, surgery was postponed, if there was appropriate communication should could have had surgery earlier saving her life
- documentation should have occurred for every visit the medical team had with vanessa, so other health professionals would be on the same page and know what's going on with her medication and her condition and the why's of why everything was done.
-  the resident should have checked her prescriptions with a more senior doctor to check if they were appropriate for this condition
- any adjustment of medication should be charted so that every health professional can see what medication a patient has had and it should be also documented in the progress notes as to why the medication has changed
-  when vanessa buzzed for help in the middle of the night, the nurse should have done a neurological assessment and a gcs to assess her, especially as she has a possible severe head injury, and all of that should have been documented
- the amount of endone vanessa received was way to high and should have been checked and questioned long before giving it to her, and if a nurse has concerns, she should open up and tell a doctor or senior medical professional straight away

in the cpg it says the duration of action of naloxone is often less than that of the opioid so i would guess that it is reversible as it must be dissociating quickly, but just want to double check.

"while there are lifestyle choices that people choose to practice are seen to influence male fertility, other factors like mental health issues play a role in male fertility as well. psychological stress, for example, activates the sympathetic nervous system and the secretion of hormones that inhibit the testicular leydig cells like the gonadotrophin-inhibitory hormone (mcgrady, 1984). consequently, the reduction in testosterone levels and the changes in sertoli cells, which suppress spermatogenesis, reduces male fertility. similarly, not only do men with high levels of anxiety are seen to ejaculate less semen and have lower sperm concentration and counts, but their sperms are also more likely to be deformed or less mobile due to their unhealthy psychological state. however, i believe that with the government's increased encouragement of and support towards psychological treatments like counselling and marriage therapy, men will be more expressive and acknowledging of their infertility and the stereotypical mentality that their 'male and marital roles are being redefined' upon seeking help will be diminished.

the factors that are statistically significant in those who took no folic acid or &lt;200g daily in supplements are modifiable in theory such as relationship type, tertiary education level and private health insurance status however, in reality are very hard to modify as they are decisions those individuals have made due to many other interplaying factors. non-modifiable factors include those widowed and those women &lt;25 yrs who are pregnant.
there are also some factors that are statistically significant that are modifiable but could be attributed to the lack of far reaching public education on certain obstetric and gynaecological topics. those who had unplanned pregnancies or pregnancies recognised later than 7 weeks were both more likely to no supplement folic acid or take &lt;200g daily. these two categories could be modified with health promotion around contraceptive use, the signs of early pregnancy and health seeking behaviour.
it was interesting that counselling during pregnancy, a modifiable factor, did not always lead to a significant increase in supplementation rates. many of those who still had counselling during pregnancy, did not supplement folic acid or supplemented &lt;200g daily leading to questions around the effectiveness of this education and also when it was in the pregnancy. was the reason that they didn't supplement because they were education after the first trimester? this analysis would have been strengthen by asking women when this education occurred in their pregnancy. as expected, no counselling was also associated with no folic acid or &lt;200g daily in supplements.
there was also an association of modifiable lifestyle factors with no folic acid or &lt;200g daily in supplements. those consuming greater than usual amounts of alcohol in the first trimester, and those doing less vigorous exercise in early pregnancy both had statistically significant odd's ratios of not supplementing folate. it would be interesting to note if this population of women had undergone pregnancy counselling. would this group have been more likely to take folate supplementation and decrease their risky lifestyle factors if they had been educated? there were also some non-statistically significant lifestyle factors that had increased odd's ratios of no folic acid or &lt;200g daily in supplements such as smoking during pregnancy and in first 3 months of pregnancy and drinking alcohol in the first 3 months of pregnancy.
finally, the majority of these modifiable factors are related to the social determinants of health. the likelihood of those from low ses backgrounds with limited education, lack of pregnancy counselling and lack of private health care to take no folic acid or &lt;200g daily in supplements is much higher. thus finding innovative and different methods for health promotion to reach this population of women would aid in ensuring more women were aware of the advantages of folic acid supplementation. whether this would lead to increased rates of supplementation it is unknown, as this study did not look at the reasons why these women did not take the folic acid, even when they were aware of the benefits. more research into the barriers these women face in pre-pregnancy and pregnancy care would be an important step to ensure greater supplementation rates.",1,F,ENGLISH
"done well: the lifeguards quickly assessed the patient and determined his was in cardiac arrest. they were organised in their procedure and the leader communicated effectively what was required, for example calling the ambulance, getting the aed, starting cpr, checking for pulse, performing assisted ventilations. they also took turns while conducting cpr to reduce exhaustion and maintain effective cpr and they also made sure no one was touching the patient when shocking. the paramedics also were cautious in case of spinal injuries. 
could do better: increasing the rate of compressions to 100-120 compressions per minute. deeper depth of compressions and allowing full recoil could also be improved on. they should have also checked the patients airway in case something was occluding his airway. off chest time should also be minimised.

"**response to your initial post, and your response to balu re violence in workplace.
thanks thomas for articulating to the group the sort of stressors and cultural norms you undoubtedly face every-day at work. ive been away from ed now for a few years, and whilst not burnt out, recognised that if i wanted to affect change i needed to get out (and complete a masters.) im sure the director and nurse unit manager are doing all they can about access block, within the traditional boundaries of management. a recent summit bought together the ama, federal government and australasian college for emergency medicine: have a read, i think youll find it interesting.1
i feel, like most of the issues our colleagues have posted about, these situations are complex and multifactorial, with many stake-holders: wicked problems indeed as alluded to by jeremy- otherwise they wouldnt make it to the news, right? the expectancy theory applies well to these scenarios: if staff do not fundamentally believe they can perform their role, due to the sheer volume of factors affecting their ability to do so, motivation is likely to be low.2 as youve pointed out, health care workers value their standing within the community; to have that challenged as a result of factors out of their control is both damaging and heart-breaking.3 if organisations fail to deliver economic and socio-emotional resources, then motivation can be adversely affected, with potentially disengaged employees as a result.4 the flow on effect as we all know, is often an increase in both safety incidents and absenteeism, along with reduced quality of service provision.5
again i think that job redesign is appropriate, but we need to think big! we know the emergency department profile as such has changed significantly over the past 10 years in particular, with drug or alcohol-affected individuals frequently present in our eds, along with a much higher prevalence of mental health patients.6 why are we not changing our staffing mix to meet these needs? we know that mixing these patients with others who have predominantly medically based illness compromises their care and safety7: why are we not changing the environment to enable high quality care for both streams of patients? the answers are there: we just need executive teams to be brave and do more than provide policies for clinicians to implement and, as you say, cope.

as mentioned, noise complaints are more likely going to cause increased levels of stress and stress-related symptoms rather than hearing loss. good ideas were brought up to minimise the noise such as having a play area out on the grass and having better insulation. i think that these would help, but overall these type of living conditions are really poor. ideally, families wouldn't be put into these types of housing arrangements and in the video it mentioned that many families demanded to be moved out of the hulme crescents. as mentioned above, noise can cause stress for other people living in the crescents. stress causing the release of adrenaline and cortisol in the body, which in turn causing side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure (berekley wellness, 2017). chronic exposure to this type of stress can even lead to hypertension and even digestive issues (berekely wellness, 2017).

"with reference to prof george pattons article, he pointed out this prospective study, with multiple points of assessment across adolescent and young adulthood, has increased the strength of the study. however, i doubt the accuracy of the assessment. error in outcome can be very high as it was conducted via telephone interview, both assessor and participants are not blinded, there are potential performance and recall bias. the limitation of this study is the outcome measurement. epds is most widely used for perinatal depressive symptoms, however, it is likely to capture anxiety symptoms too. thus false-positive results may have resulted. inconsistent assessment method was used, like ghq-12, cidi, icd-10 at different periods of time. also, the determination of the symptoms can be subjective, and the assessment is not done by the same person. thus there may be detection bias.
lastly, postnatal depression can also be due to other causes like the social disadvantages listed in the articles: intimate partner violence, previous loss of pregnancy and etc. it is not possible to distinguish the confounder factor, depression itself is caused by multifactorial factors. psychosocial interventions throughout the studies can also disturb the result. thus, instead of saying postnatal depression is a continuation of existing mental health problems, i personally think it can also have other conclusions like mental health problems in early life have long term continuation effect in a persons lifetime.",1,F,MANDARIN

"i apologize for the late post. considering that we are discussing virtues or as i would possibly describe them as personal strengths relevant to the moral character of the person the easiest approach would be to describe the characteristics that you would consider a suitable role model in psychiatry to possess. i cant think of anybody better suited for the purpose than sigmund freud.

freud epitomizes what it means to be brave, independent and committed to the profession irrespective of the criticism or even rejection that he had experienced from the medical establishment at the time. he was driven by boundless curiosity and compassion ( or in today parlance called empathy)deeply involved in the patients histories however clearly displaying incredible maturity and sensitivity with respect to their privacy and confidentiality. in his case histories for example he went to incredible lengths to change the narratives and prevent any disclosure of the patients identities. he was very clear about the importance of maintaining professional boundaries however openly discussed his own struggles especially in the early years of his career when developing his method of suggestibility (actively exploring his patients sexual fantasies and this before he fully realized the importance of transference and counter-transference).

what i believe however to be especially relevant today is his humanity and understanding of difficult and troubled personalities and maintaining a professional distance independent from the prevailing opinions of the general public of the time.

drawing on my own clinical experience? certainly there had been times when i had to stand up for what i believed was the right decision with respect to management of a patient irrespective how that may potentially influence my assessment and future prospects. confidentiality is a tricky one especially in the age of electronic records and relatively widespread access to medical and personal information however especially important in our times of scrutiny and potential for exploitation. personal boundaries and the possibilities of transgression would be no doubt the most important virtue defining a professional relationship.",1,M,SLOVENE

(2). equally, i have gained much from seeing how some leaders in my organisation are displaying what i now perceive to be high emotional intelligence at this difficult time. 
george, as cited in day and leggat 

(3), asserts that leadership is an emotion-laden process and this is true never more so than now. there are a number of leaders in my organisation who appear to be managing their emotions and handling stress well.  this is arguably due to having a high emotional intelligence 

(3).  those leaders have yielded the best responses from their teams in terms of dealing with the upheavals caused, and changes required, by covid-19 in a public healthcare setting.

in my experience, i have also gained benefit from being aware of some of the not so good behaviours around me. as an emerging leader, i hope to be able to self-reflect, improve my self-awareness and emulate the positive behaviours displayed, while learning from the negative ones.
louise, i wish you all the best as you navigate this time as a new leader of your team.

"do you think that citizens accessing public health care have a responsibility to look after their own health?

in a word yes. 
as has been discussed in detail in this module spending for health care services is spread across many different sources. 
the australian government provided 68% of revenue for health expenditure in 2013-14. 
the majority of that money is collected from taxation. 
this fairness in financial contribution is very effective method of income redistribution, 
however as the cost is shared across all households, 
all those households share a responsibility to look after their own health.

citizens who engage in activities putting them at increased risk of illness, are more likely to access the healthcare system. 
a patient who is obese, secondary to a poor diet with lots of processed high calorie high sugar food, 
has been smoking and lives a sedentary lifestyle, will be very likely to develop medical illness. 

these lifestyle choices increase risk of t2dm, cvs disease and respiratory disease. 
i would argue this patient is at least partially responsible for their poor health, 
as they made choices about their lifestyle in the past which have been linked to poor health. 
this patient will most likely require multiple hospital admissions 
with many procedures and many medications to manage their health. 
the cost of that care is distributed amongst all citizens of australia, 
yet many of those citizens will access the benefits from that payment less than others.",1,M,GERMAN

"hey everyone!
my name is alivia and i am a first year biomed (single degree) student. 
i find developmental biology very interesting and, in the future, would love to do research or pursue a career in medicine.

i am discussing the topic that recent studies suggest that sperm quality is declining. 
from the graph shown in the discussion topics book, we can clearly see a decline in sperm quality throughout time, 
specifically a decrease by 1.9% per year, a decrease by nearly a third. 

this study reveals that human interference with reproduction may be a cause to the decrease of sperm quality. 
for example, we know that the most common cause of reproduction difficulties is due to male infertility. 
this interference, by reproductive techniques such as icsi, is going against natural selection, 
and is thus, reproducing and recreating these infertile genes to be passed on to later generations.

however, human interference in natural selection, that is art, is not the only factor contributing to this decline in sperm quality. 
possible factors include, drug use, whether that be cocaine, marijuana, or even anabolic steroids. 
with the legalisation of marijuana in some countries today, we may see an even larger decrease 
in sperm quality as the possibility of the use of marijuana becoming widespread increases.",1,F,ENGLISH

"hi karen my apologies for the late reflection to your post, i mustnt have pressed submit properly earlier in the week 
and only just realised my response didnt come through but i thought id send it through in case it adds any value. 

you describe an unfortunately not uncommon scenario with increasing demand for acute inpatient beds and challenged capacity to meet demand 
(1). and without all available information i can only surmise the process undertaken that led to the undesirable outcome you describe and the possible reasons for limited engagement and consultation with a number of stakeholders prior to decisions being made and implemented.  it is assumed that persons managing access would have considered all available options prior to making the informed decision you describe, particularly with the known risks involved and the decision affecting so many stakeholders as you appropriately highlight. stakeholders that likely would have benefited from early consultation in the planning process 

(2).  from my experience, in these types of situations there are often few available alternatives and limited time for broad consultation and engagement (beyond that described in the escalation plan, the affected patient, their medical unit head and charge nurse, and that of the person requiring an inpatient bed), with a patient potentially already undergoing an emergency operation with an interim plan for management in recovery until an inpatient bed is found. hence potentially the use of hard tactics from those holding legitimate power, even though i agree that your suggested use of softer influence tactics would probably be better received. use of referent power (if held), may also have been helpful to maintain staff morale until necessary conversations can take place with other key stakeholders to address concerns and areas of uncertainty associated with decisions made 

(2).  fortunately i have never seen a decision like this made for financial or economic productivity reasons. it has usually been a last resort to enable an unwell person requiring admission, access to an inpatient bed and associated care that is otherwise not available.  you are absolutely correct that better and broader communication and engagement should be undertaken wherever possible and where appropriate, that transfers like you describe are best avoided, and all the evidence-based suggestions you have made are ideal. if the situation does not allow for broad early consultation (beyond the immediate charge nurses, treating doctors, and affected patient at the time of decision making and implementation), perhaps follow-up opportunities for further discussion, debriefing and feedback may also be worth considering.  

thank you for the very real example of how difficult it can sometimes be to implement and execute what we know to be best practice consultation and engagement
during planning and decision-making, particularly when available options appear to have opposing positive and negative possible implications for the two patients concerned and their respective health care providers and support persons.

"one potential disadvantage of ebp is the risk of publication bias. 
it isnt always certain that we have all of the available evidence (positive or negative) when using the evidence to make a clinical decision or guideline recommendation.

for example, with the study orthopaedic surgeons: as strong as an ox and almost twice as clever? 
(1) there may have been other studies undertaken in which the anaesthetists scored better in the strength or intelligence tests, but the orthopaedic surgeons may have preferred to only publish the study in which they outscored the anaesthetists. 

this publication bias is referred to by ben goldacre in his ted talk (2), in which he gives examples of being misled by the evidence due to the likelihood that positive studies will be published significantly more often than negative ones. minimising publication bias would enable more confidence in decisions based on the evidence available.

"bock 1 (topic a) part 2 question 1 response i would like to comment on another way of how i would handle the situation.  1) while i am trying to reason with the man threatening me, the shop assistant should try moving from the back of the store to alert the police.[1] additionally, if the pharmacy closes during the evenings and is situated at a busy location, people outside would eventually find out what the situation was.[1]  2) the man could actually be a regular customer; and/or someone suffering from psychiatric problems [1] (thus needing drugs of dependence) or financial burdens (hence, unable to afford his medications), which led him to take up such drastic measures. he probably came to this pharmacy because he was familiar with the surroundings/staff in it.  3) if i know the man personally, although dangerous to me, my staff and customer, i would attempt to reason with him if he is undergoing some emotional stress, trying to distract him from what he is doing. this is particularly advantageous in smaller community pharmacies, where i have observed a personal rapport shared between pharmacists and regular customers. the elderly, psychologically/emotionally, etc. distressed often share their problems while discussing their medications with the pharmacists, and pharmacists lend a listening ear.  4) while this altercation is taking place, the police might arrive and help ease the situation by either firmly leading the man out of the store by himself and warning him, or having to forcefully take him out if he gets aggressive.[1]  5) i would make sure that remaining pharmacists and staff members of my pharmacy and other nearby pharmacies are alerted of the man, his demeanor and what occurred, such that this doesnt repeat again.  i think, there is no right or wrong when dealing with such cases, and it really depends upon the gravity of the scenario and who is handling it.  references: 1. oxtoby k. how i coped with a hostage situation [internet]. uk: chemist+druggist. 2016 apr 22 [cited 2020 jan 22]. available from: https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/feature/how-i-coped-%e2%80%a6-hostage-situation.",1,F,ENGLISH

going for a long walk, listening to music, drawing, baking, running, talking to friends and family, going to the gym, jogging, cooking, sleeping without having to set an alarm, making yourself a cup of coffee and watching tutorials on youtube are what some of us do.
trying to carve out time to do it is more important than sitting at desk for hours.

learning plan:
most of us reflected on oral communication and teamwork skills.
we can ask teammates to assess our teamwork skill by completing rubric when catme isn't available.
do things outside of our comfort zone e.g. speak up in group when no one does, reflect on how we did and do better next time.

smart goals:
to improve teamwork skill: what do i need to do? be specific e.g. be proactive in team meeting? how many times will i do that?
to practice empathy: how exactly do i be empathetic? e.g. allow more time for patient to talk?
""golden minute"": let patients talk for 1 full minute without interruption. do not fill in silence and let them do it instead. for example, the goal could be to listen actively during that 1 full minute in the 3 next role plays in this semester.
importance of setting a date: by when should i have achieved the goal? when it is now the date, have i done it?
it can be a good idea to go back and have a look at our reflection done in previous years and measure how far we have come along.

identify our own strength (via strength profile):
recognising our own strengths can be useful to remind ourselves of the qualities we have.
this helps shift our focus and allow us to utilise our good qualities effectively.
it is recommended that we do the survey repeatedly as time goes by to see our changes.
work on our strengths, a lot of the strengths are what a good leader should have - we may find yourself developing leadership as our strength along the way.
these core strengths are the foundation on which we build your technical skills (e.g. oral communication, teamwork, leadership).

why is identifying strengths important?
research showed that strength-based approach contributes to mental health recovery by encouraging them to work on their strengths and resources they have rather than focusing on their deficits.
this approach is not only applicable to mental health patients, rather it is beneficial for all patients.
identify what our patient is good at doing, instil the concept of strength into the patient and let them discover what they can do with their strengths.
the idea of patient-led conversation: let them come up with solutions that they think they are able to do for a problem e.g. non-adherence.

"hi everyone, 
as discussed in the previous tutorial, there was a brief discussion on the use of a doppler machine to perform abpi at our pharmacy before the initiation of compression therapy. this is mainly to rule out arterial causes of leg ulceration and also calcification within the arteries prior to initiation compression therapy for which both are contraindicated (vicaretti, 2010). the machine is easy to use, and allows us to 'close the loop' for the patients, avoiding the hassle of running around to multiple health care professionals which we often found led to poor health care as continuity is lost.

"dear brindha, i was not sure if your additional questions were intended to only be answered by joshua. hence, i will further contribute to joshua's first answer to question 6. thank you.
joshua, thank you for your response! i appreciate your input, and for sharing your insight into the dispensing and supply processes undertaken both in your community and hospital pharmacy settings.

dispensing of medications:
at monash health, when dispensing a prescription via merlin (the dispensing software), a number of systems are put into place to minimise the risk and occurrence of errors.
after confirming the validity of the script, the medication details are checked and investigated to ensure the dose, strength, directions and medications themselves are appropriate prior to dispensing the product. this is completed by reading; the medication details of the original script, patient notes on merlin and emr (electronic medical record) and online medication resources (e.g. amh, therapeutic guidelines, emims, stockley's drug interactions, etc)(1). information gathered upon receiving the prescription (i.e. patient details including; past medical history, allergies, use of other medications, etc.) are also taken into account. these assist with making a clinical judgement with regards to whether or not the script is appropriate and safe for the respective patient.
upon entering all appropriate details into merlin, a medication and address label are printed.
the pharmacy staff member will then take the original prescription with them when collecting the medication rather than the printed label (as to ensure the most accurate source of information is used to collect the product)(2). the pharmacy staff member will double-check that all their items have been correctly dispensed and the labels contain no errors (i.e. correct patient name, product, quantity, medication name, instructions, etc.).
after scanning the barcode of the dispensing label and the barcode of the product itself, the medication label is then clearly attached to the product with the addition of ancillary labels (2). the pharmacist will then perform another check of the dispensed medications, and do a final scan of all the medications.
now that all medications, invoices, cmi's and medication lists (where appropriate) have been checked by the pharmacist, these items are placed into a paper/plastic bag with the patients address label on the outside of the bag. this ensures the correct selection of medications upon supply. 

supply of medications:
when supplying the medications, three unique identifiers are used (patient full name, address, d.o.b or urn) to ensure the right medications will be supplied to the right patient (1,2). the patient's docket (which is printed upon receiving the prescription) is also collected and matched to the pharmacist copy of the docket. the address label on the outside of the medication bag is also used to identify that all these medications will be supplied to the correct patient.
as to ensure no errors have occurred during the dispensing process, each medication (whilst counselling the patient), undergoes a final check to ensure the correct product, strength and directions are provided. the patient's details on each label and the expiry dates of each product are also confirmed.
counselling of each medication may then commence (as described by joshua). as an intern, i ensure that i summarise 3-5 of the most important counselling points, and use the ""teach-back"" method to ensure my patients will be able to safely use their medications. patients are also encouraged to call the pharmacy if any questions arise.
after counselling and providing all required documents, the patients urn is used to process the payment (or the patient may choose to pay later via details described on the invoice).

additional strategies:
- expansion of the pharmacy department will allow for more workspace. there is the potential for error in that, a staff member may accidentally collect a nearby medication that another staff member may be processing for a different patient due to the small workspace.
- making sure all staff double-check their own work before handing the dispensed items onto a pharmacist, will assist in minimising errors that may be left unidentified. this allows more chances for an error to be identified before it can reach the patient.

i first typed lems into the search box on the homepage of the cochrane library. it yielded 1 result which answered my pico.

using mesh terms for 3, 4-diaminopyridine it resulted in 3 systematic reviews but only 1 involved the drug in lems patients. 
i also searched mesh terms for lems it resulted in 1 systematic review which i could use for my pico (the same trial which appeared in the earlier searches)
i am fortunate that lems is a rare disease as it allowed me to simply search for the medical condition alone.  other medical conditions have copious amounts of studies to search through. i tried searching hypertension the simple search bar on the homepage and it resulted in 328 cochrane systematic reviews. therefore, for common medical conditions i can see the advantage of trialling different search techniques. i am glad i am more confident in navigating the cochrane library for future searches.

"does the person making the declaration sign the form in front of the witness or can they sign it before they bring it to the pharmacist/pharmacy? 
the person who is making the declaration can type or write the statutory declaration before getting it witnessed but they most not sign it until they are in the presence of the witness, in this case a pharmacist.
does the declaration need to have a specific statement on it? 
the declaration has to have the statement 'i am an authorised statutory declaration witness and i sign this document in the presence of the person making the declaration'
do you need to request identification from the person requesting youwitness the stat dec? 
it is not a legal requirement to request identification from the person requesting a stat dec to be witnessed, however it is often done to confirm the person's identity if they are unknown to the pharmacist/witness. pharmacists often request identification if they believe that the claim may be false.

"sorry for my late response.
other questions i would add to elizas questions of for some of the questions she has already asked, the rationale behind asking them are-
 1. whether there was any sexual assault involved? if yes, would they like to speak with a police officer? (for this reason alone, like you said grammy, i would want to speak with the girl herself and not the boyfriend)  this is in order to refer them to a gp/family planning clinic/sexual health clinic and sexual assault services to help with the physical and psychological trauma.[1] 

2. whether they used contraception? if not, then i would recommend them to get an assessment of their sexual health just to eliminate any risks of sexually transmitted diseases and preventing it from spreading to multiple partners.[1] 

3. number of hours since the last unprotected sex? this is because, prostinor-1 has no effect beyond 72 hours of intercourse and there is a chance that the embryo has already implanted itself in the uterus. levonorgestrel works by inhibiting ovulation, thus preventing fertilisation of the egg. although another prostaglandin pill called ulipristal works up to 5 days.[1,2] in our pharmacy we always counsel the patient that the more time passes by from the intercourse, the less likely the pill is going to work. 

4. any recent episode of diarrhoea or vomiting? 
if yes, there is a chance that the medication wont be absorbed by the body, leading to pregnancy and they will have to get another dose from a nearby pharmacy.[2] 

5. if they are currently breastfeeding? 
although levonorgestrel is safe to use during breastfeeding, other pills like ulipristal are not, and suggested that the breast milk be expressed and discarded for up to 36 hours.[1] 

6. have they taken any pregnancy test recently? 
if yes, when was it taken and what was the result? (positive or negative) this is an essential question to ask, as many women come with the misconception that the pill can help abort an embryo, which is not the case. it is more to act in the earliest stages prior to conception, by inhibiting ovulation and embedding of embryo into uterus lining.[2] 

7. any medical conditions?  
specifically those that can cause contraceptive failure, such as-  crohns disease- this is a malabsorption syndrome that can reduce the absorption of the pill.[1]  epilepsy-it is believed that hormones controlling pregnancy and menstruation can increase seizures in women.[3] because anti-epileptics like carbamazepine, phenytoin, etc. are enzyme inducers, which can metabolize the pill and reduce its effect.[4]  diabetes- because progesterone and estrogen hormones are believed to alter blood glucose levels, and monitoring is required.[5]  breast cancer- because the hormone pill increases the likelihood of at risk women to get breast cancer, especially those over 40 years of age.[6]  severe liver disease- can affect the metabolism of the drug and decrease its action.

 8. have they suffered from any ectopic pregnancy in the past? 
levonorgestrel has a side effect of possible ectopic pregnancy, and if any female has experienced one in the past, there is a higher chance for them to experience it again in comparison to a female who hasnt.[1] 9. are they on any medications or supplements? 

major concerns are antibacterials (like rifamicin and rifabutin); antifungals (griseofulvin); and herbal supplements (st. johns wort) are all enzyme inducers, increasing hepatic metabolism of levonorgestrel.

"in what way might my previous experience (e.g., jobs, family, healthcare) guide myparticipation in the project?
- i do not have family support here in australia, but i do have pacific island friends that check up on me often. and having that support is important because sometimes, doing when doing research, i can get stressed out and worry. but then i have friends that would help me relax and refresh. i am not working currently because of the project because i want to put my focus on the research and so i am readily accessing google drive throughout the day.

2. what experience have i had with this type of research?
i have no experience with systematic review.

3. what results do i expect to come out of this project?
the results would centre around learning analytics in health professions so i expect that the results would show, 
- advantages/disadvantages, limitations in la. 
- also, i expect to see some sort of trend in the use of la and which is used more often combining this with other factors that contribute to the success of la in health professions such as the environment at which this occurs. 
- i expect that there would be discussions around the current research in this area and perhaps new insights to la 
what is my stake in the research? what do i hope to get out of it?
learning how to read the articles. learning how to skim and scan but not missing out on important bits of information.
the how to write would probably be a focus since i have little experience is doing research.

"10.who is responsible for determining the scheduling of medicines in australia?
'in australia, scheduling is a national classification system that controls how medicines and poisons are made available to the public.medicines and poisons are classified into schedules according to the level of regulatory control over the availability of the medicine or poison required to protect public health and safety.' (1)

dangerous drugs and chemicals are restricted to enable their safe and effective use thus the reason behind scheduling.

--&gt; the senior tga medical officer makes the scheduling decisions whilst taking into account the advice of the advisory committee on medicines scheduling.
--&gt; the higher the number of the schedules- the more access is restricted. for example schedule 3- ventolin inhaler which is available without a script but is available for pharmacist prescribing.compared to schedule 8- endone which is available only with a script and is stored in the safe.
 --&gt; scheduling is in legal terms a state matter, but all states now adhere closely, or entirely, to the poisons standard, which is administered by the department of health
--&gt; once scheduling decisions have been made, they are published on the tga website. (2)

when speaking to the pic, she said it was quite difficult to establish and 'a lot of questions had to be answered and boxes ticks' which took a while and they had to get a council permit. before starting, all staff had to be trained on safe needle practice and needlestick injuries, as do all new staff.
the pharmacy has 2 sizes of plastic disposal containers that are free for patients requiring them, as well as 3,5 and 10ml syringes for free. there are other items such as condoms that an nsp site can give out but my pharmacy doesn't have/order these items for the nsp. full plastic disposal containers can be returned to the pharmacy where they are placed into a large bin (similar procedure to rum bins) which is kept in a locked room.
in the last few months, the pharmacy has started a methadone program. at present, they only have one patient while they trial the program and work out how to run the program but they are hoping in the future to use their rapport built with nsp clients to encourage them to to participate in the methadone program. they do already do this but there isn't really a location nearby for patients to go to so its often not successful.

"insomnia used to be classified as primary or secondary depending on whether or not there was an identifiable cause for the sleep disturbance. some possible causes of insomnia include other medical conditions such as depression, anxiety,restless leg syndrome, sleep apnoea orchronic pain conditions. (1)it can also be due to poor sleep hygiene practices such as exposure to blue light at bedtime from mobile phones or computers, performing stimulating activities such as watching tv or eating in bed, or even exercising too closely to bedtime resulting in an inability to fall asleep. the worry about getting to sleep can also perpetuate and worsen the insomnia, becoming a viscous cycle. (1) insomnia is also a common adverse effect of many medications such as pseudoephedrine, some antidepressants, steroid medications like prednisolone, etc. this is why it's important to check what medical conditions or medications a person may be taking, as there are many different factors that could contribute to somebody's insomnia.

(2) as tapering/weaning/ceasing/switching antidepressants can potentially precipitate withdrawal/discontinuation symptoms, doxepin would need to be tapered slowly, with potential small increments every week or second week over at least 4 weeks, however this may need longer depending on how long the patient has been on doxepin (3)

"5. highlight the areas in the dispensing process that are at risk of privacy breaches
according to the victorian pharmacy authority (vpa) guidelines, the dispensary is a private area dedicated to the dispensing of medicines and the secure storage of patients records. dispensaries should be designed in a manner that prevents an unauthorised person from entering the dispensary without the pharmacists on duty knowing.1 when receiving prescriptions or assisting patients with health advice, important health information is collected. therefore it is important to maintain a high level of privacy.
there is a high risk of privacy breaches when collecting health information, with other members of the public nearby. to prevent privacy from being compromised, the vpa guidelines state that pharmacies should be designed in a way that allows pharmacists to discuss any matters with patients without compromising privacy and confidentiality. pharmacies should have a distinct area that does not allow any members of the public to see the medication or listen in to the counselling. this means barriers should be installed (such as opaque privacy screens that rise at least 600mm above the bench, forming a booth) to privately discuss sensitive information with patients.1 additionally, when talking about sensitive information or counselling patients, pharmacists should speak at a volume which does not allow a third-party to hear and maintain privacy.
there is also a risk of privacy being compromised once personal information is collected (such as a prescription). this can be minimised by not leaving any personal information unauthorised, where the public can access. privacy can also be breached when affixing the dispensing label over a label that was previously placed on the primary container. the new label can be removed by patients which would expose another patients details. therefore it is important for pharmacists to remove any old labels before affixing a new one.1
privacy can also be compromised when handing out prescriptions. there have been many examples when the wrong medication has been handed out to the wrong patient. this can be prevented by asking the patient for three points of identity (such as name, address, date of birth or medicare number). medications should also be placed in a confidentiality bag to avoid other members of the public from seeing the medications.2

"hello group b,
what do you consider to be the main differences between conducting a research project and a quality assurance activity?
in general without reading i would have considered that the premise of the activity was the main difference. however further reading has highlighted some conflicting information in relation to this question.  (simone has also mentioned the sahln (2018) documents, which i have used- but these are relevant to my worksite so i am using this again).  quality assurance and research projects do not have to be mutually exclusive (the university of kansas, 2020).  salhn (2018) documents state that quality assurance includes evaluation of current practises particularly in relation to service improvements and short surveys.  further salhn (2018) outline practises that are particular to research including the setting up or use of databases to answer clinical questions, investigation including the use of tissue samples outside the normal scope of practise, comparisons using a control group, studies of patient experiences and testing new practises, equipment or medications.
quality assurance generally looks at a fixed population, often investigating the implementation of policies and their effectiveness with a work site (the university of kansas, 2020). quality assurance is also perceived to have a lower risk threshold as it is already using data from current practises based on policies and guidelines (the university of kansas, 2020).  frequently quality assurance activities are undertaken as part of internal worksite audits (the university of kansas, 2020). therefore quality assurance does not include patient consent directly and may be linked to the general worksite patient consent process. (the university of kansas, 2020).
quality assurance does not necessarily require an ethical review however a form is still required to be submitted to evaluate the request (salhn ,2018).
thanks, amanda.

i have learnt a lot through this unit about the process of using a database search to answer a clinical question. this unit has allowed me to familiarize myself with databases i had not used previously such as the cochrane library. going forward i will opt for an advanced search using mesh terms and boolean observers for majority of my research as i have definitely seen the advantages of this search strategy. i am more likely to find relevant articles and know how to adjust my search to potentially narrow down the results if there are too many to screen. i will also incorporate identifying what the study design is into my search to follow the hierarchy of evidence. other sources of information i will continue to use are summary resources such as lexicomp and micromedex as they are regularly updated and referenced.,1,F,ENGLISH
"once the immediate situation has been defused, it needs to be reported or documented. the information documented about this situation will be used to prevent further errors from occurring. when looking forward the pharmacist needs to address how this error bypassed all the checkpoints that has been designed to identify errors. this is done by reviewing the dispensing process and evaluating each stage of the process. this should be done in a systematic way and should not be ignored or isolated to a single individual, this is to ensure that this selection error does not occur again by anyone at the pharmacy.
issues to address would be
dispensary workflow and whether there are any distractions or interruptions
workload assigned to each pharmacist
the storage of medication in the dispensary (e.g product label, placing medications with similar packaging/names in close proximity)
use of bar code scanners to verify medication selected
final check by the pharmacist

in this situation, i would ask lydia:
since it has been two days ago since your medication was dispensed, have you taken any tablets?this question should be asked for the safety of the patient as it has been dispensed two days ago.
have you used penicillin in the past? this question should be asked upon handing out the medication, especially if the patient does not have a dispensing history of penicillins, but it is best to confirm this with the patient now that they are currently under my duty of care.  if i was not the dispensing pharmacist of this medication or did not hand it out to the patient two days ago, the person at the time may have overlooked or forgotten to ask the patient this question.
when was the last time you have taken penicillin?
how was your experience with it?
what symptoms did you experience (if any) from the pencilling allergy? asking these questions will help me determine the type of reaction they've previously experienced with penicillins (immediate, delayed) and overall nature of their allergy (acute, moderate, severe).
is your doctor aware of your allergy to penicillins? this may have been a prescribing error or that the doctor was not informed of the patient's allergy to penicillins.
which type of respiratory tract infection was this medication prescribed for? to assess the quality use of this medication for the patient
first and foremost, i must prioritise the patients health. by asking the questions above, i can assess the situation and use my professional judgement to help the patient. depending on the nature and severity of the patient's allergy to penicillins, it may be necessary that i contact the prescriber to change the penicillin to an alternative medication that is appropriate for the patient.",1,F,VIETNAMESE

it would be best to call triple zero (000) as soon as possible as an absolute priority as well as describing to them the description of the offender. also let the police know if any injuries occurred at the scene so as an ambulance can be called.
once the premises has been closed, it would be advisednot to clean anything upuntil police have examined the scene and can gain as much evidence as possible.
ask anyone involved in the incidence, to stay to discuss with the police; if they don't want to stay, aim to get their contact details for follow up later with both police and out of curtesy (as you mentioned).
staff and customers should also avoid discussing the incidence until after police have interviewed them in order for them to obtain an true and observed recollection.
do not discuss with anyone what and how much was stolen aside from who requires this information as it could make your pharmacy more of a target.
notify the work health and safety regulator of any injuries if anyone requires in-patient care.

"question 1.
what prevention strategies can pharmacists directly provide?
counselling (in a private counselling area) about the importance of protected sex e.g. when someone presents for contraception, genital symptoms, etc.
most if not all pharmacies sell condoms.
what prevention strategies can pharmacists enable people to access?
it is a good idea for pharmacists to have details of local services that do sexual health check ups, e.g. local gp clinics, family planning victoria and mshc websites.
question 2.
apart from the sti prevention strategies discussed in question 1, what else can pharmacists do to promote sexual health?
pharmacists are an easily accessible health professional for patients. we can promote sexual health when patients present with genital symptoms, when they present for contraceptives, etc. although we do not need to go into the details of their sexual practices, we can ask them do you have any concerns about your sexual health? if they do, we can refer them to a gp or sexual health clinic.
we should assure patients that sexual health check ups (e.g. sti testing) are necessary, important, non-invasive and very simple to complete with their gps.
name one specific thing you pledge to do as a pharmacist to allow people in the community to achieve this state.
to not bring judgement or discrimination into patient interactions, to be accepting of everyone and being that private confidential person that the patients feel safe to talk to.

"thanks for the feedback erica, i will make sure to choose victorian references in relation to legal questions for next time.

the dpcs regulation that outlines emergency directions to pharmacists is mainly regulation 25 and within this regulation, sub-regulation 4 &amp; 
5 outline that the verbal instructions given must be written down on the prescription and sent to the pharmacist. 

however, by law and the previously mentioned regulation does not specifically state that it must be within 7 days, this deadline was only mentioned in my other references and not the dpcs regulations document.

"nephropathy diabetic nephropathytypically develops slowly, and is characterised by a progressive increase in albuminuria that is later followed by a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr).1 however, a decline in egfr can also be seen without albuminuria. diabetic nephropathymay eventually lead to end-stage kidney disease.1
additionally, patients with diabetes can also develop other kidney diseases unrelated to diabetes.1
pathophysiology2

monitoring 
key risk factors for progression of diabetic nephropathyinclude long duration of diabetes, suboptimal blood glucose concentrations, elevated blood pressure, suboptimal blood lipid levels, obesity and tobacco smoking.1 treatment of these risk factors in the early stages of chronic kidney disease with intensive glycaemic control, optimisation of blood pressure and the use of renoprotective drugs reduces progression of kidney damage, morbidity and mortality.1

type 1:

start screening 2 to 5 years after diagnosis (after age 11 years) unless at higher risk due to comorbidities1


assess at least every 12 months and more frequently if results are changing1

type 2:

assess at least every 12 months, and more frequently if results are changing1

 management options



to reduce the risk of progression of diabetic nephropathy, optimise the patients glycaemic profile and blood pressure.1


for patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of, or with establisheddiabetic nephropathy, consider use of antihyperglycaemic drugs with evidence of slowing progression of diabetic kidney disease, such as the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (sglt2) inhibitors or liraglutide.1


for patientswithelevated blood pressure and any degree of albuminuria who have type 1 diabetes, use of a high-dose angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (acei) slows the progression of kidney disease.1in ws's case perindopril could be started and titrated to 10mg daily.


for patientswithelevated blood pressure and any degree of albuminuria who have type 2 diabetes, use of either a high-dose acei or angiotensin ii receptor blocker (arb) slows the progression of kidney disease.1


for patientswithoutelevated blood pressure who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macroalbuminuria, treat with an acei or arb.1


for patientswithoutelevated blood pressure who have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria, treatment with an acei or arb can be considered. treatment reduces progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria and reduces risk of cardiovascular events but does not reduce progression to end-stage kidney disease.
in all cases its important to treat the patient not just the numbers and to weigh the risks and benefits of these treatments before starting.

"study 3: atrial fibrillation and cognitive function: case-control study
i agree with angus that this study is a bit tricky to classify as either prospective or retrospective. personally i would say it is more prospective than retrospective, and that is primarily due to the fact that the outcome (cognitive decline/dementia) has not occurred in the selected participants, yet. that means that the study can't really be retrospective, therefore has to be somewhat prospective. however, it does not follow the group for an extended period of time to see who actually does develop cognitive decline. 
regarding study weaknesses there are a few other things i couldn't clearly identify from the study. the validity of the tests performed to be able to predict cognitive decline wasn't mentioned. they demonstrated that the the nvaf group currently scored lower on the test series, however it's hard to directly establish a link between the tests and future scores or even the development or worsening cognitive decline. another issue with using this data to prospectively determine risk of new onset/worsening cognitive decline is that it doesn't take into account genetic variation. we know that cognitive decline in many neurological disorders, both those that directly affect memory and those that don't, have a large genetic component linked to the extent of cognitive decline particular patients might suffer from. a larger sample size would help this slightly as already mentioned by angus.",1,M,ENGLISH

"s: female, 86yrs old, lives home alone, presented to hospital following a fall and fracture of left wrist.
o: currently taking paracetamol 500mg prn and oxycodone 5mg prn for pain relief.
a: currently experiencing uncontrolled pain at a 7/10 and complaining of trouble going to the bathroom, most likely opioid induced constipation.
p: i would recommend reviewing the patients pain management. i would consider optimising the use of paracetamol to 665mg 2 tablets three times a day. if extra pain relief is needed endone 5mg should be considered instead of oxycodone controlled release tablets, as controlled release tablets are not appropriate for acute pain treatment (1).
if opioids will be used ongoing then a laxative such as docusate with senna should be initiated to prevent/treat opioid induced constipation (1). 1 to 2 tablets of coloxyl and senna can be used at night-time with a glass of water for constipation relief the next day (2).
opioid sedation is a risk in elderly patients. due to the patient being 86 years old removing the opioid should be considered due to the increase risk of falls from sedation. nsaids are considered first line for acute pain management in elderly. consider using celecoxib as it is indicated for pain due to injury, 400mg as a single dose on day one, then 200mg once or twice a day if needed.

"one problem with swapping brands i have encounter quite a bit while working in hospital is whether a particular control release brand can halved. a very common example is isosorbide mononitrate, where duride, imdur and monodur 60mg tablets are scored hence, can be halved where as isobide mr, isomonit cannot be halved. 

therefore when a doctor is trying to increase/decrease patient's isosorbide mononitrate dose by 30mg it is important to know which brand can be halved and which one cannot be halved.[1] 

another example that i have see every day is, different brand of perindopril with different equivalent strengths (2.5 mg of perindopril arginine (e.g. coversyl, prexum) is equivalent to 2 mg of perindopril erbumine (e.g idaprex, indosyl mono, perindo)).[2] 

the only brand my hospital stock is indosyl mono. when doctor chart up perindopril 2.5mg because the patient was taking coversyl 2.5mg, the nurse gave 1 +  of indosyl mono. in order to avoid this mistake again, pharmacist just ask doctors to chart 2mg, 4mg or 8mg of perindopril. 

another factor that need to be consider while patient in the hospital is if patient have ngt which means they will not be taking their medications orally and this is where mims-crash? becomes my best friend.  

in hospital we dont decide what brand we want to stock, the victorian therapeutics advisory group and victoria governments decide what brand of medicines the hospital will stock, which is on the contract therefore thats the brand we can stock. 

unless the supplier is out of stock of the particular brand on the contract, we cant buy any other brand.

"reflection	action
what surprised you about your colleagues responses?	my reflections after reading my colleagues responses are: 
		what surprised me was the numerous things pharmacists can be involved with in terms of a patients sexual health. it surprised me because i had a preconceived idea that we were only able to counsel them on available prevention services, instead of being directly involved. 
now that you have read other peoples responses, is there anything you would like to add to your own answers?		pharmacists can also perform the following roles to prevent stis and promote sexual health: promoting vaccinations for stis, providing flyers and information booklets, simply being a listening and non-judgemental ear for the patient
looking at the pledges your colleagues posted in response to question 2, how many are different to your own? reflect on how important you think each of these is.	
		i think olivias pledge is very important, because it treats the patient as a human, and not just someone who needs some medicine 
		this pledge will reduce stigma and hopefully reduce the incidence of stis in the community; as more people are educated on how to treat or prevent them",1,F,MANDARIN

as with panadol osteo(r): i see no reason as to why we can't consider using it. my thoughts are to increase the frequency to regular as tuka mentioned before in his plan to provide a baseline cover for her pain. ideally this would stop her oxycodone use. the panadol osteo(r) is a slow release formulation that provides long term cover for pain relief when used regularly. it has the added benefit of tds dosing (or in this case potentially bd depending on clinical judgement) and as such would decrease the pill burden in comparison to taking regular paracetamol 2 tablets qid.

"i had not considered the gi upset aspect of metformin. i had opted to reduce both gliclazide and empagliflozin due to risk of hypoglycaemia and side effect potential with empagliflozin that sheri mentioned. my rationale was also that metformin is seemingly well tolerated currently.  what i did find was that in patients where it is appropriate to relax bsl targets, recommendations for target bsls are somewhat broad and vary depending on which reference. etg bsl range of 10-20mmol/l had a higher threshold than other resources such as   palliative care australia seek assistance is 4mmol/l or &gt;15mmol/l (1)  racgp recommended range of 6-15mmol/l (2) by both of these other resources a patient would need to seek medical advice if they had a bsl reading of 16mmol/l but not with etg suggested range.  what this highlighted to me was that any bsl targets need to be individualised for each patient, we ensure a clear plan is established and agreed upon in consultation with the patient and clear documentation is provided of the steps for the patient to take according to the bsl result. this will hopefully avoid unnecessary visits to a doctor, provide more patient autonomy and reduce symptomatic hypo or hyperglaemia.

'pharmacy assistant' and 'pharmacy technician are often used interchangeably however their qualifications and daily tasks differ. the pharmacist should ensure that tom and ella are equipped with the skills acquired from a recognised training program, and at a minimum for the dispensary technician, be able to exhibit the skills and assist in the appropriate selection of medicines, labelling and and dispensary processing of prescription medicines, under the supervision of a pharmacist.
with different qualifications available for pharmacy technicians for the provision of various pharmacy services, both clinically in the hospital or the community, pharmacy technicians may also participate in outpatient clinics, be supervised whilst undergoing clinical ward rounds, manage extemporaneous compounding and offer outreach services.  
a pharmacy assistant has undertaken a minimum level of either certificate iii in community pharmacy, or certificate iv in community pharmacy. they aid the pharmacist and/or the pharmacy technician in the safe delivery of pharmacy services in community pharmacy. this is conducted through providing pharmacy assistants with the skills to perform basic administrative tasks required in the pharmacy, as well as the ability to retrieve the best possible medical history from patients or their carers for the pharmacist to be able to work with.

"1. in this situation, the pharmacist does not need to ask the patient for consent before ringing dr morris. the dpcs acts states that if a pharmacist is presented with a prescription and believes the patient was supplied in the previous 8 weeks with the same poison written by a different doctor, the pharmacist must as soon as possible take reasonable steps to inform the prescriber who wrote the current prescription about the previous supply. (1) the psa code of ethics for pharmacists discusses what ethical obligations pharmacists must meet when delivering patient-centred care. in this case, the pharmacist exercised professional judgement in the interest of the patient which does not require them to obtain consent from the patient. the pharmacist demonstrated competency as they showed that they were able to work collaboratively with others to deliver patient-centred care. (2)
2. the pharmacist has not breached the patient's privacy by calling dr morris. it is the pharmacist's legal obligation to ensure that if a previous drug of dependence had been prescribed by a different doctor within 8 weeks that the most recent prescriber be notified. the pharmacist was fulfilling their duty of care to the patient as well as their legal obligations related to the pharmacy profession. (2) app 6 looks at the use or disclosure of personal information. as the pharmacist believed that the disclosure of the patient's previous supply of medications was necessary, the pharmacist did not breach the patient's privacy. (3) victorian pharmacy authority guidelines state that pharmacists must ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained however information may be disclosed to another health care professional who is treating the patient if it is in the best interest to divulge this information. (3)
3. as panadeine forte is not a drug of dependence and there is no legal requirement to contact the prescriber if a previous supply within 8 weeks had occurred, this medication can be dispensed. however, the pharmacist would need to ensure that the patient is taking the medication appropriately and not abusing it.
for temazepam and diazepam, the pharmacist should check safe script and see what were the quantities and dosages prescribed by dr lester 3 weeks ago. the pharmacist can also click on 'view access history' to confirm whether dr morris had viewed safe script as he was not at the clinic. if dr morris had not checked safe script and the quantities prescribed for diazepam and temazepam were quite minimal, the pharmacist may dispense these medications to the patient. however, it is their legal obligation that they notify dr morris as soon as practicable once the supply had been made about the previous supply.

"latrobe regional hospital has slowly been introducing new measures to increase patient and staff safety regarding the coronavirus. 
the hospital has dedicated two wards to any patients queried to have coronavirus to keep them isolated from the other areas of the hospital. 
all staff were also quickly educated about the donning and doffing process for personal protective equipment and re-educated about hand hygiene practices.

the hospital has restricted its visiting times to between 2pm and 4pm each day, with only one visitor allowed in the room at any time, 
to minimise the infection and spread risk. 
the hospital also questions every visitor on their travel history and checks their temperature before entering the hospital. 
they also do this with every patient who enters through emergency and every patient admitted onto any of the wards.

the hospital has also just started swabbing the staff to ensure all staff at work are safe and not spreading the coronavirus.
the pharmacy department itself, has divided into two teams which work out of the main pharmacy and satellite pharmacy. 
the two teams cannot interact in an effort to avoid all pharmacy staff being infected, and there being no pharmacists available to work. 
the pharmacy department decided that patients own medications (poms) were best when left in the medication room on the ward 
or in the patients locked bedside drawer, and when poms bags were not recycled for different patients, so to help stop the spread of coronavirus. 

as a pharmacy that usually sends their patients to the pharmacy department to collect their discharge medications, 
it was decided that the ward pharmacist would deliver and counsel the patient on their discharge medications at the patients bedside, 
as to avoid the patient stopping on their way out of the hospital and to prevent unnecessary contact with other people. 
the pharmacy department also encouraged all staff to stay up to date with coronavirus information by visiting the hospitals coronavirus intranet page 
and completing the victorian governments coronavirus training module online, to stay up to date with information, myths and hand hygiene practices.",1,F,ENGLISH

"hi mei-jung and julie
i agree that the structured questions do help an inexperienced interviewer with a starting point 
but i think there is a danger as so much more information is required for a holistic wound assessment. 

everyone needs to start somewhere so the interviewer must be supported by colleagues 
who can challenge and help them develop their knowledge and understanding that the questions particularly by sussman and bates-jensen are just the very basics. 

questions that address other factors affecting wound healing such as nutritional status, hydration, mobility and sensation disorders, immune status, medications and co-morbidies to name but a few need to be considered. cost considerations for some patients can be paramount. 

i have seen many patients the community who have had instructions from specialists that do not take into account the cost of the supplies. 
they have to make choices between purchasing the required dressings or medications or indeed sometimes food. this factor did not appear to have been considered and causes the patient untold stress.

structured questions provide a good starting point but cannot cover every possible situation encountered so this limitation must be acknowledged.

-	remain calm at all times
-	notify the supervisor / pharmacy manager / pharmacist in charge of the incident 
-	wash the area with cold running water and soap
-	apply an antiseptic to the area and cover with a band-aid

"for exercise 2 titration curve: a: ph of solution of the weak acid (the analyte)  b: pka of the weak acid  c: half equivalence point  d: ph of the salt solution (conjulgate base)  e: equivalence (stoichiometric) point of the titration  f: ph of the solution of the strong base (the titrant) 

for exercise 2 questions: 1. comment on the curvature and justify the shape of the titration curve. the titration curve is sigmoidal with an abrupt inflection point. this is due to the addition of strong base into the weak acid, so neutralization starts occurring and ph slowly climbs in the early stages, since the [a-]/[ah] is very high (so the buffer is weak); then capacity of the buffer rises as it approximates half-equivalence point, when [a-]/[ah] = 1 and the ph value is the same as the pka of the weak acid, the buffer formed is the most resistant to base additions, that is why this part of the graph is almost flat. the continuous addition of base leads to the equivalence point when the moles of strong base added equals the initial moles of weak acid in solution, resulting in the abrupt vertical shape of the curve at that point. after that, the buffer gets weaker again as the [a-]/[ah] value gets very low. after the inflection, as the base keeps being added, the only present species is be oh- so the ph starts to stabilize again and turns to look flatter as it approached the ph of the strong base solution.  

2. suggest a suitable indicator for this titration. justify your answer. phenol red (pka 7.9) is the most suitable indicator for this titration since the equivalence point has a ph of 7.9, so when the color of the indicator starts changing it means that the equivalence point is very close or reached. 

3. in exercise 2, you determined the ph values for several points in the titration. state to which point in the titration each ph value corresponds. point 0: starting point point w: slightly neutralized point x: half-equivalence point point y: equivalence point point z: end point",1,M,PORTUGUESE

"hi amanda,
here is my feedback to you.
keep
- using points from your level in the competency statement to structure your context and impact statement
- using examples which are supported by strong pieces of evidence such as feedback from people you have supervised or your own supervisor.
start
- e43 might be worthwhile expanding on the description in your cloe so you can give some detail about what your performance appraisal contains
- e74. do you have further evidence to pair this up with. maybe feedback from attendees or an attendance record. this will really help to link your final sentence of the first paragraph with the first sentence of the same paragraph. alternatively, does the email you received from the senior technician mention that you have been chosen for this presentation due to your exceptional role modelling, mentoring and coaching. if so perhaps add this to your description.
- could you break up the last couple of sentences in your second paragraph? youve mentioned some good points, however it can be more effective with the use of shorter sentences. i was thinking instead of being responsible for supervising the pharmacy interns on clinical wards, i uphold the balance between fostering their clinical independence and providing supportive supervision with timely constructive feedback..could you go straight the point and say i uphold the balance between fostering the clinical independence of pharmacy students and providing supportive supervision with timely constructive feedback.
- you may have some more words for your final sentence if you do this so it doesnt appear rushed.
stop
- noticed in the first sentence of second paragraph that there is a gap after residents and before [e35,54,60,61,65-68], you could gain an extra word and stay consistent with the rest of your paragraph by combining; ie. residents[e35,54,60,61,65-68].

"i found this article by hopkins et al (2006) which offers a rare insight into the lives of patients with pressure injuries. these patients were above 65 years old had at least a stage 3 pressure injury. they analysed the transcript and found 3 main themes of endless pain, restricted life and coping methods. the endless pain had 4 subthemes of constant presence, keeping still, equipment pain and treatment pain, while the restricted life had 3 subthemes of impact on self, impacts on others and consequences. i was struck by how the irony of how they would prefer to remain still to reduce the pain which was what led to the pressure injury. 
the themes resonate with my clinical experience of those with more advanced pressure injuries and reflect those of patients with chronic illnesses.

"hi julie and group a,

i looked at some of the mental health effects:

with the limited information provided about mrs spring it is unclear on her mental health status prior to her wound developing. 
however, i note that mrs spring has constant pain which is likely to have a number of impacts in addition to psychological stresses such as sleep disruptions, poor diet and social isolation etc which will all lead to poor healing outcomes. 

it is well documented that psychological stress such as chronic pain, anxiety and depression have a detrimental effect on wound healing (matsuzaki &amp; upton, 2013). studies have shown an increase in symptoms of pain and odour associated with anxiety and depression, although in mrs springs case it is unclear which came first, the effect with accumulate (matsuzaki &amp; upton, 2013). 

mrs spring is also at a much higher infection risk due to the reduced immune functions associated with psychological stresses (gouin &amp; kliecolt-glaser, 2012). firstly, a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines are shown to reduce the early stages of the inflammatory stage which are essential for immune function (gouin &amp; kliecolt-glaser, 2012). 

in addition to this, reduced mmp release causes a decrease in the breakdown of extracellular matrix and collagen which in turn attracts less immune cells to the wound site (gouin &amp; kliecolt-glaser, 2012). 

there have also been direct links shown between insomnia and more severe infections which was noted as a result of lower epidermis levels of cathelin-related antimicrobials (gouin &amp; kliecolt-glaser, 2012).

1: it provides useful information to medical staff. 
author made conclusion that after comparing paraffin gauze, alginate alone, alginate with film, film alone via the small experimental. according to the healing process, clients who have alginate with film have shortest healing period, while paraffin gauze should be avoid using as it brought disconformable, causing more pain (beldon, 2004).

2 quality of experimental
articles conclusion was based on an case studies( strength of evidence framework level b).  sample of case have 40 participants. (baxter, 2001) with quasi experimental studies (baxter, 2001). when author design this experimental, she used patient satisfaction survey, to collect pain scale. author also used heal day as parameters factor to measure efficient of types of dressing (beldon, 2004)., both descriptive research and the experimental research have been well designed and used into this experimental. 

in discussion paragraph, author cited several design faults, such as gender, nutritional status and size of wound site (beldon, 2004). however, i would more believed author intend to exclude above factors when she designed this experimental as all experimental sample information collected from one wound clinic, size of clinic has been restrict the experimental sample, not the failure of experimental.

"1.how does the aetiology of constipation differ in a child (compared with constipation in adults)?
constipation in adults: adult bowel frequency can vary from3 times per day to 3 times per week.constipation in adults is defined by presence two of the following:

two or fewer motions per week

straining at more than 25% of defecations

a feeling of incomplete evacuation at 25% or more defecations

hard lumpy stools

sensation of anorectal obstruction or blockage for at least 25% of defecations

manual manoeuvres needed to facilitate at least 25% of defecations (eg digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor)

common causes of constipation in adults involve:
use of medications that can cause constipation as a side effect

inadequate dietary fibre and hydration

inappropriate bowel habits (eg ignoring the urge to defecate)

inadequate physical activity (eg from decreased mobility)

change in environment (eg holiday, entry into a residential aged care facility)

painful anorectal disorders (eg haemorrhoids, anal fissure)

loss of muscle power caused by other medical conditions (eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

functional faecal retention and stool withholding behaviour are the most common causes of constipation in children. other causes include:
allergy to cows milk protein
reduced stool volume and dry stools caused by poor diet, and hydration 
slow-transit constipation
pelvic floor muscle dyssynergia.

"thank you eleanor for that article. i found it quiet interesting that this systemic review had found that long term raloxifene only reduced vertebral fractures where as long term alendronate and zoledronic acid therapy also reduced non-vertebral fractures. can you please elaborate on some general factors to consider when contemplating a bisphosphonate drug holiday? things that you need to consider when thinking about a drug holiday include
(1):
how long have they been on treatment for?
if they have had a pathological fracture in the past?
if they have any radiological evidence of lesions or impending fracture?
if they are of medications that affect done homeostasis or density such as glucocorticoids, androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, excessive thyroid hormone replacement, long term heparin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antieplileptic drugs, thiazolidinediones and proton pump inhibitors.
if they are at high falls risk and therefore would be at higher risk of fractures.
if they have any lifestyle and factors that effect fracture risk e.g smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, physically inactive, low vitamin d, low calcium, and low protein.
if they have any disorders that affect bone homeostasis or density such as endocrine disorders or malabsorption syndromes, low weight, ra or haematological disorders.
monitoring bmd and if it decreases more than 5% at any major site or if a fracture occurs to consider alternative therapy or asses adherence.
i agree with your response that we could consider a drug holiday for bmd, given she has not had any recent fractures, depending on her bmd. if we were to do this, it would be important to optimise other management strategies  what would this include? i guess it would be important to try to minimise minimal-trauma fractures by(1):
encouraging the patient to do more physical activity. exercise has bee proven to lower bmd and prevent minimal-trauma fractures.
stop smoking
maintain adequate calcium and vitamin d levels
maintain ideal body weight
increase the amount of weight bearing exercise and balance training
monitoring bmd. consider checking after 2-3 years and if decreasing significantly (by 5%) then consider re-starting treatment.
limitting alcohol to moderation
preventing falls e.g adjusting drug therapies, improving vision and providing walking aids

-	how old is sue?
-	is she pregnant or breastfeeding?
-	does she take any regular medications?
-	does she have any other medical conditions?
-	does she have any allergies to medications?
more specific questions regarding her condition.
-	what type of wound does she have?
-	is it infected? swollen? painful? red? hot around the area?
-	has she been to the doctors regarding this wound?
-	has she used anything on it so far?
-	how long has she had the wound?
-	has its condition changed at all? is it getting better, worse, or is the same?
-	who recommended the chlorsig ointment?
chlorsig ointments active ingredient is chloramphenicol which is an antibacterial indicated for bacterial eye infections (1). other indications include prevention of infection after corneal abrasion and ocular surgery (1). however, it is not indicated for wounds. 
i would explain to her that this medication is not used for wounds but rather eye infections. if she suspects that the wound is infected, she needs to go to the doctor to get a prescription antibacterial medication to help treat her wound. it is also important that the doctor looks at the wound to see if it needs to be closed using stitches or glue.
i would let her know that this medication is pharmacist only medication (2) and we are only able to supply this medication if there is an appropriate therapeutic need for it like bacterial conjunctivitis. we are unable to supply the medication for her as the medication is not indicated for her condition.

i have learnt that the research process is not always fun or even interesting. sometimes, due to the repetitive nature of scientific research, it is monotonous. i have found that i find it difficult to repeat the same process over and over again without disengaging, and need to constantly remind myself to keep consistency in order to ensure reliability of results.",0,M,ENGLISH
"hi diana! thank you for your response! i had very similar answers to you but just wanted to add to your response. question 1 i also agree that mrs mitchell would benefit from an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (achei). the other factor i considered is whether she is pbs eligible for the drug. achei are subsidised on the pharmaceutical benefit scheme (pbs) when the diagnosis is confirmed or made by a geriatrician, neurologist or psychiatrist and the person must have an mmse of 10.(1) therefore as long as mrs mitchell meets the pbs criteria, she would be eligible for pbs subsidy for the medication. question 3 like you, i had also chosen donepezil. i had narrowed down my options to donepezil and galantamine but my deciding factor that i considered was cost. if mrs mitchell does not have a concession card then donepezil would be the cheaper option according to the pbs website.(2, 3)question 4 i absolutely agree with you that both verbal and written counselling is required in cognitively impaired patients. another possibility, would be aiming to have a carer or family member listen in on the counselling points as well.(1) i think this is more of a luxury in a hospital setting where family or friends would be available during the hospital visit or at least available on discharge when taking her home. before commencing counselling, i would also identify what other medications mrs mitchell is on and what time of day she takes these other medications to see how donepezil can work into her current medication regimen or routine.(1) as you have mentioned compliance is more important than the time of day to take donepezil. question 5 from my research, i also found it hard to compare the acheis with memantine due to the former being used more in mild to moderate disease and the later in moderate to severe disease. however, i would just like to share and elaborate on the evidence i found for this question: there are limited comparative trials of anticholinesterases.(4) however, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine seem to have similar efficacy and safety.(1, 4) head-to-head comparative studies and indirect comparison by sub-analysis of data for the three different acheis did not demonstrate superiority of one over the other.(5) although, it has been reported at full oral doses rivastigmine causes more gi adverse effects than the others. (4) additionally if gi adverse effects are intolerable with oral formulations, the rivastigmine transdermal patch has been shown to cause less nausea and vomiting compared to the oral form.(5) memantine has a similar profile in terms of efficacy in modestly improving cognition, global impression and adls.(5) memantine showed a clear benefit in patients with moderate-to-severe ad but its benefit was not clear in mild-to-moderate ad.(5) memantine seems to be better tolerated than acheis in that its side effect profile was similar to placebo, and the dropout rate and proportion of patients who developed adverse effects was comparable with placebo.(5)question 6: i actually was all for the combination achei and memantine therapy. this is because in moderate-to-severe ad, there is some strong evidence, through large rcts, to show that there are favourable outcomes with the combination therapy (achei plus memantine) versus achei monotherapy.(5) this includes improvement in cognition, functional and behavioural factors, overall impressions and general delay in clinical worsening.(5) other longer term studies showed that the combination therapy slowed down cognitive and function decline when compared with monotherapy and no drug treatment.(5) furthermore, there was no significant difference in adverse effects and dropout rates when comparing the combination versus monotherapy group.(5) therefore, once a patient enters the moderate-to-severe stage of their disease i would recommend the combination therapy and monitor for tolerance of adverse effects. my theory is that if there is the possibility that the patient can delay their disease progression by a few extra months or years, than taking an additional table may be well-worth it, especially if the side effect profile of the combination therapy seems to be quite limited.question 7 i actually was not against trialling an alternative achei ins mrs mitchell. i do agree that there is limited evidence to support the switch.(4) however, i did find that it is recommended to ensure optimal dosage of achei is achieved and trialled for at least 6months before considering switching agent.(5) if tolerability is an issue, then a wash-out period of 7 to 14 days, depending on individual drug half-lives, is recommended before commencing an alternative achei treatment.(5) as previously mentioned, the rivastigmine transdermal patch would be the most suitable option if intolerance to gi adverse effects is motivation for the switch.(5) however if consideration of switching is motivated by lack of benefit, then a washout period is not required.(5) therefore, i would recommend switching between one achei to another regardless of motivation being efficacy or tolerability, as long as the initial achei dose and duration has been maximised. but i also understand your point of view in that trialling acheis, especially for long-periods as recommended, could cause unnecessary side effects with limited improvement in cognition and function, especially if the patient does not have that kind of time. thus, like you said it would involve extensive discussions with the patient, carer and geriatrician.question 8 i think you answered this question perfectly! i agree about restarting the donepezil dose at 5mg initially and titrating back to 10mg, to reduce adverse effects. the only thing i would like to add is: donepezil has a long termination half-life of 70 hours and steady state is achieved within 3-weeks after initiation of therapy.(6) therefore, a 5 day disruption in therapy should not cause too much of an issue in terms of efficacy.references: 1. tan ec, hilmer sn, garcia-ptacek a, bell js. current approaches to the pharmacological treatment of alzheimers disease. aust j gen pract. 2018;47(9):586-92. 2. the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. donepezil canberra (australian capital territory): australian government - department of health; [cited 2020 mar 8]. available from: http://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/11922l-2532g-8495d. 3. the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. galantamine canberra (australian capital territory): australian government - department of health; [cited 2020 mar 8 ]. available from: http://www.pbs.gov.au/medicine/item/11917f-2463p-8770n. 4. australian medicines handbook online [internet]. anticholinesterases in alzheimers disease. adelaide (s. australia): australian medicines handbook pty ltd 2020 [cited 2020 mar 7]. available from: https://amhonline-amh-net-au.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/chapters/neurological-drugs/drugs-alzheimers-disease/anticholinesterases-alzheimers-disease?menu=vertical#anticholinesterases-alzheimers-disease-comparative. 5. wong cw. pharmacotherapy for dementia: a practical approach to the use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. drugs aging. 2016;33(7):451-60. 6. mims online [internet]. apo-donepezil. crows nest (nsw): mims australia; 2020 [cited 2020 mar 8 ]. available from: https://www-mimsonline-com-au.eu1.proxy.openathens.net/search/fullpi.aspx?modulename=product%20info&amp;searchkeyword=donepezil&amp;previouspage=~/search/quicksearch.aspx&amp;searchtype=&amp;id=97740001_2.",1,F,ENGLISH

start:
consider adding evidence of additional organisation guidelines you have updated.
in regards to e25, consider including a copy of the guideline, rather than just the email correspondence relating to the guideline update.
in regards to e42, from your consolidated list of evidence, this is an email requesting your involvement in the collection of data on vte risk screening. in your context and impact statement, could you refer to undertaking audits as well as presenting audit results to more closely link the e42 intext citation to the wording?
in regards to the last sentence of the first paragraph, were you involved in the development and/or implementation of the strategies to inspire change? do you have evidence to cite to support this sentence?
review the second paragraph with the aim of relating it more closely to assisting others in the team. for example, were your colleagues involved in your follow up of the medication-related incidents or the prevention of these incidents in the future?
in regards to e47, your consolidated list of evidence states this is correspondence requesting you follow up a medication incident. does the correspondence also clearly demonstrate your follow up of the incident and the associated findings?
in regards to e20, what did your orientation of new medical doctors involve? did you develop a presentation that you could include?
gather and cite evidence that demonstrates the impact of your examples throughout your context and impact statement. the evidence currently cited predominately relates to your input.
consider separating your context and impact statement into two paragraphs, one for each aspect of the competency statement at the transitional level to clearly demonstrate how you fulfil this competency statement.

dont forget to write in present tense, where appropriate. for example, i am responsible for rather than i have been responsible for

i approached this competency statement by thinking of times when i have identified a problem, fixed it (or tried to fix it) and involved others in that process. perhaps this might help you to focus this context and impact statement on your contribution to creating the vision and your assistance of others in the team, as kirstie mentioned. i feel its still predominately focused on implementing the vision of others or your organisation as well as activities youve completed yourself.  hope that is helpful. caitlin",1,F,ENGLISH

"mrs morgan is a 86 year old female who was admitted into the rehabilitation ward after a fall and fracture of her left wrist. she had complaints of muscle pain and has since stopped taking her cholesterol medication without the doctor knowing.
she had a blood test 2 weeks ago with a total cholesterol level of 3.8 mmol/l and currently not taking any cholesterol lowering medication.
the target level for patients on lipid lowering medications is &lt; 4.0 mmol/l. given her recent blood results, it would seem that her previous cholesterol medication was maintaining her lipid levels well. however we would need a full lipid profile to determine her true cholesterol control.
i would recommend ordering a blood test to get a full picture of her cholesterol control. additionally i would recommend investigating the cause of the muscle pain that mrs morgan was experiencing to ensure she was not experiencing any unfavourable side effects from her previous medication. if her previous medication was causing her muscle pain (ie a statin) and she still requires a lipid lowering agent, i would recommend starting her on ezetimibe 10mg once daily.

"a near miss is a significant dispensing error as it suggests that risk management measures may not be in place.
 if circumstances where slightly different, such as if the pharmacist had been more distracted or if they were more fatigued than usual, the error may have been overlooked. 
had the near miss not been picked up, there is a chance this would have had a detrimental impact on mr and mrs careys health, as well as potential consequences for the pharmacist.

mr and mrs carey should be informed of the near miss as the pharmacist had already begun counselling mrs carey for the mobic. 
by returning and then counselling mr carey on the mobic, this is likely to cause confusion for mr and mrs carey regarding who should be taking the mobic. 
furthermore, it portrays the pharmacist as unprofessional. 
if a pharmacist admits to their near mistake, i believe it shows that they are more trusting and that they genuinely care about the patient's wellbeing and their right to be made aware of anything that may negatively impacted them.

it is also necessary to report the near miss to pdl and document the incident in the dispensing history. this should be done not only in case a complaint is made, as already mentioned, but to prevent this mistake from occurring again in the future. as dispensing errors may be the subject of investigation, pharmacists should follow a risk management procedure which includes appropriate documentation. according to the guidelines, the record must show when the incident was recorded, when it occurred, who was involved, the nature of the incident, what actions were taken, and any conclusions. the guidelines state that complete details must be recorded regardless of how serious the incident may appear.

according to the pharmacy guidelines, good practice indicates that a systematic approach in dealing with errors and near misses should be implemented so that these mistakes do not happen again, and corrective action is taken. 
alongside what stephanie has already mentioned, other measures i would put in place to ensure this mistake does not happen again 
include speaking to the pharmacy owner/manager about potentially having additional pharmacists, intern pharmacists, dispensary assistants, 
or pharmacy students to help out if it is regularly busy on saturdays. 

in accordance with the guidelines, pharmacists should ensure that workloads are reasonable and manageable to ensure patient safety, 
provide professional and appropriate pharmaceutical service in a timely manner, and cope with fluctuations in workflow. 

furthermore, a dispensary risk management plan should be implemented in the pharmacy to minimise the chance of dispensing errors and near misses. this includes but is not limited to the establishment of an efficient dispensary workflow to limit distractions, the management of workload, and the adjustment of dispensary environment.

"hi sally and group a
the recording of my 24-hour intake was easy as i am currently using a delivered meal program which provides all food that i am allowed to consume. happily, this program adhered to all the recommendations for healthy diet enabling me to score 10 points. 
i have a goal which is driving my eating behaviour at the moment. one in which i am invested financially and emotionally. this makes it easier to not cheat. i am aware however that eating like this  for the rest of my life  will be very unlikely.  
i am 100% sure that my score at any other time would be quite different. i have a sweet tooth and sometimes find it challenging to restrict the treats and i also dont particularly like many fruits so would rarely meet the 2 pieces a day recommendation. 
i think that maintaining a diet that adheres to the guidelines all the time is very difficult in this day and age. just a few issues that i can identify with particularly (dont want to pinch them all as others will have lots of ideas too) are: 
	cost  you can feed a family of four very cheaply at maccas. 
	normal portion size  only have to go out for dinner to see how much food is presented  this portion size gradually becomes the normal. 
	ease and accessibility of junk food  healthy choices are in the minority at a trip to a caf, food court, takeaway and who wants to pay good money for a salad!  
i dont like to think in terms of good and bad food and i think this guideline presents food in this way. i think that the everyday/sometimes/rarely position makes all food accessible and less daunting to have to make change.
i think presenting this guideline to a patient and asking them to adhere to it all would be overwhelming. a better strategy would be to pick one recommendation that they think they could stick to and and just work on that. once that change is made then add another and then another.

"according to dpcs regulation 2017, regulation 56:
a pharmacist must not sell or supply a schedule 4 poison in an emergency situation unless the pharmacist is satisfied that:
the supply is necessary to ensure continuity of treatment and
there is an immediate need for the poison and it is impracticable for the patient to obtain a prescription in time to meet that need and
treatment with the poison has previously been prescribed for the patient by a registered medical practitioner, dentist, nurse practitioner, authorised midwife, authorised optometrist or authorised podiatrist and
the patient, or an agent of the patient, or a person who has the care of the patient, or a person who is assisting in the care of the patient, is aware of the appropriate dose of that poison for that patient and
the sale or supply would not continue treatment that has already been continued by the pharmacist selling or supplying the poison to the patient under this regulation (1).
in this scenario, i do not think it is appropriate to supply the panadeine forte  for the patients joint pain as this is not the indication the medication was originally prescribed for. additionally, unlike other regular medications (such as the antihypertensive medication i previously gave the patient an emergency supply for), panadeine forte  is generally not recommended to be used continuously, often used as a when required medication unless the doctor has recommended specifically. therefore, it is not necessary to continue treatment with this medication.
if i do not supply the medication, the patient may experience some joint pain until he sees his doctor. therefore, i can recommend non-pharmacological advice (such as rest, massage, exercise) and other otc analgesics that are appropriate and safe for mr barack (such as paracetamol and potentially nsaids if the patients blood pressure is well controlled) to provide continuity of care.
additionally, i believe it is not completely impractical for the patient to visit a gp to obtain a prescription for panadeine forte. for this particular medication, any gp can prescribe this medication as they do not require any special permit. therefore, the patient can visit any gp clinic that is open during the afternoon if his regular gp is unavailable.
therefore, i do not think it is appropriate to supply the patient with panadeine forte in this scenario. as a pharmacist, i will always ensure to try to put the patient first by providing the patient with other non-pharmacological and pharmacological options and providing contact details of gp clinics that are open during those hours. additionally, i will empathise with the patient and show that i do understand the patients situation and am trying my best to help them as much as possible.

'manuka honey vs. hydrogela prospective, open label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial to compare desloughing efficacy and healing outcomes in venous ulcers' with activity number 2.
1) was prognostic balance maintained as the study progressed? 
the prognostic balance was maintained throughout the study as evident in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. during the study the patients remained in their allocated study groups throughout the study and withdrawal occurred if patients commenced on antibiotic or immunosuppressive therapy, infection either in the study wound or elsewhere, non-compliance to treatment or at own request. 
2) to what extent was the study blinded? 
the study was a blinded (double) study as the allocation of the patients was randomised. patients were allocated to either groups via randomly allocate serial numbers in sealed envelopes and allocated patient via remote phone allocations. also, the statistician who was involved in the analysis was also blinded to the treatment allocations. 
although throughout the trial it was determined that the study group which were the medical honey group were able to be determined due to the orangy peri skin discolouration. this then potentially could have led to some bias to the study. 
 3) were the groups prognostically balanced at the studys completion? 
all allocated patients were analysed at the completion of the study, even if they withdrew for whatever reason. the study reported even through there were withdrawals from the study, this did not affect the outcome of the study. 
 4) was follow up completed? 
at the completion of the study, it was determined if the wound was healed or not healed at the 12-week mark (study end). this allowed for full analysis of the study outcome. 
5) were patients analysed in the group to which they were randomised? 
yes, all patients were analysed in this study and the reduction of bias was evident as the analysis follow the intention to treat principle, thus all patients were analysed in the groups to which they were allocated, analysis even included the participants whom withdrew from the study 
6) was the trial stopped early? 
this study initially was designed to compare 2 equal groups of 78 participants with a total of 156 participants over a 3-year period. unfortunately, the total number of trial participants was able to be recruited during this timeframe, therefore and an extension of recruitment was increased and still not a full number of participants were recruited.",1,F,ENGLISH

[2]the poisons standards has listed cannabidiol (2% or less) contained in preparations as being schedule 4 and nabiximol(sativex), tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol present in equal proportions, making up 90% of a mixtures content, as being a schedule 8.[3] thus, tilray is likely a schedule 8 medicine, meaning it definitely cannot be advertised to the public and needs to be stored in a safe within the pharmacy - out of vision and accessible only to the pharmacist. sativex, a cannabidiol preparation was listed as causing dizziness and increasing the effects of other sedating medications, but did not drowsiness or sedation itself, thus likely it doesn't need the sedation warning statement.[4]

"hi everyone,
	i came across this article quality of life and self-esteem in patients with paraplegia and pressure ulcers: a controlled cross-sectional study. the study explored the perceptions and feelings of patients suffering from sci with pressure injuries who are mostly young to middle aged adults belonging in the working group population. it has been identified that pi occurrence amongst people with sci are caused by urinary and faecal incontinence due to the neurological damage effects resulted by trauma. results showed the following:
1.	people with pi has poor physical functioning because of the limitation in completing adls yet has adapted to these limitations over a period of time
2.	significant pain experienced by patients with pi has been found to have an impact on the patients perceived health status serving as a constant reminder of the wound presence.
3.	psychological issues such as negative emotional factors, worrying about healing, relationships, body image and social isolation associated with pi profoundly leaves negative impact on a persons overall quality of life.
overall, it is recognised that presence of pi in the middle aged population undesirably affects a persons self worth, confidence and value diminishing their positive outlook towards themselves and their social lives because of their loss of control in societal belongingness influencing their level of anxiety, depression and happiness. 
	i havent had much interaction with younger population affected by pressure injuries in my workplace however, it is clear that the social and economic impact of pi on the individual, family and community is immense and can have long term physical and psychological consequences in ones life regardless of age group or economic status.

"in the psa code of ethics, care principle 3b states that a pharmacist exercises professional judgement in the interests of the patient and wider community. this essentially mean that pharmacists should be considering the patients/communitys feelings, goals, preference and in this case financial situation when providing professional advice/recommendations.
if patients could not afford these items there are some options available including getting the podiatrist to refer mrs morgan to a gp for a prescription. since the prescription is being written by a medical practitioner it will be processed under the pbs and therefore concession rates can be applied and mrs morgan will be able to purchase the medications for a lower price. alternatively, she may also be eligible for pharmaceutical allowance which is a regular payment from centrelink to the patient to help ease medication costs for patients. there is certain criteria that is required to be eligible but if she is already with centrelink then she will most likely be eligible.

"the only time a commercially available product can be modified is under 2 conditions: (1)
1. there exists details that includes the ""stability and formulation of the modified product"" 
this means that if there is no information that suggest it appropriate to change the flavouring if the product, then it is against the guidelines to do so. this is because of possible harm caused to the patient if the formulation is changed. 
2. after communication with the prescriber, patient, agent. 
if there is an existing formulation that suggest chocolate flavouring will not affect the stability of the product, then contacting the doctor would be the next step.

below is my revised statement:
4.3.2 foster initiative and contribute to innovation, improvement and service development: general level
i contribute to identification of quality improvement opportunities for the pharmaceutical service i provide to patients and other health professionals. for example, i developed a table on an excel spreadsheet that is accessible to the prescribing team at the correctional centre for the purpose of documenting, tracking, and monitoring of hepatitis c treatments at the correctional centre.[e16] this enables us to effectively and efficiently communicate clinical information. i also created a letter template to be used when providing written counselling to prisoners who get discharged/released before their course of hepatitis c treatment is completed to ensure continuity of care and adherence to treatment.[e36-37]

i contribute to professional activities planning and development in identified priority areas. as an example, an issue of long-term use of gabapentinoids without any apparent indications was raised in a team meeting comprising of prescribers, clinical nurse consultant and pharmacists. in response to this, i was proactive and took the initiative to write up a suggested dose reduction protocol for gabapentinoids in the correctional centre setting to ensure safe dose tapering and avoid withdrawal adverse effects.[e37,39] (181 words)",0,F,KOREAN

dr kristy lane had clearly self-prescribed clomifene and diabex, hence the prescription should not be dispensed to satisfy the regulations. inform this information to dr kristy lane.
many medical practitioner dont realise that self-prescribing is illegal in victoria, as it is not unlawful for medical practitioners to prescribe schedule 4 poisons in all other states. therefore, pharmacists are encouraged to not allow medical practitioners to contravene this legislation inadvertently.

"study 4: a cohort study of diabetic patients and diabetic foot ulceration patients in china.

the type of study
observational analytic, prospective cohort study
features consistent with this study design
- this study contains peco components so it is not a descriptive study.
population: diabetic patients and diabetic patients with foot ulceration
exposure: risk factors such as demographic information, medical and social history, peripheral neuropathy disease, periphery artery disease, nutritional status, diabetic control.

comparison group: diabetic patients
outcome: foot ulceration in diabetic patients
- cohort study contains similar groups of people (in this case, diabetics) with the only difference being the exposure of interest to (risk factors mentioned above) then follow-up (one year follow-up) to monitor development of outcome of interest (foot ulceration in diabetic patients).
- this is a prospective study because the outcome of interest was developed after the determination of exposure and collection of baseline information. it has one year of follow-up period to find out the risk factors of foot ulceration in diabetics.
potential weaknesses
one of the disadvantages of a cohort study is time consuming. the duration of the study can be very long that it can possibly increase the cost of the study. also, if the duration is long, the maintenance of follow-up could be difficult. in addition, the study is susceptible to the withdrawal from patient due to time commitment or loss of follow-up due to unforeseen event such as death. in this study, it took one year to follow-up and 46 patients passed away during the study.",1,F,CANTONESE
"question 7
my obligations as the pharmacist is to ensure patient safety and educate the mother why it's not recommended to add things to the suspension. furthermore, i should also provide mrs singh with alternative options to ensure that penelope is receiving her doses of antibiotics.

i would let mrs singh know that it's not recommended to add things to the prepared mixture as it might tamper with the stability of the suspension (e.g. cause uniform distribution) . furthermore, adding chocolate flavouring agent will contaminant the batch and increase the risk of microbial growth (may lose sterility prior to the 14 days expiry after mixing [1]).

instead, i could recommend to mrs singh to mix each dose in a small amount of fruit juice, yogurt, apple sauce or even chocolate pudding. this way it may mask the taste of the medication without altering the stability of the entire batch. it is important to let mrs singh know if she does decide to do this, make sure she only mixes with a small amount of food/drink to ensure that her daughter has received the whole dose required.

"given benny is a health worker with a considerable amount of physical work, i would suggest following methods for him to try managing the acute lower back pain:
- heat, although the effect could be small and short-lived, applying a heat wrap or heat pack at the area of soreness may reduce muscle spasm, thus improving pain by relaxing the surrounding muscle. it is easy to apply at very low cost and can be used as many times/duration as pt wanted.
- massage, although not much scientific evidence supports its effectiveness, it is one of the most chosen options by patients due to the satisfaction and relaxation involved in the process.
- acupuncture, only if benny is interested or previously experienced it. there are limited but inconsistent results regarding acupuncture thus personal preference should be considered.
due to the nature of benny's work, it is likely that the acute lower back pain may be occupational related. studies found that excessive load on heart functioning, the force on the lower back, repetitive force exertion on the upper body, frequent trunk bending and etc. all contributed to substantial physical demands and risk of workers. therefore it may be helpful to have a referral to a physical therapist/physiologist to have better education on a systematic approach to managing symptoms with moderate activity and self-care during work. as the acute lower back pain can affect the ability to work, a tailored exercise and relax program from physiologist can promote earlier return to work and reduce long-term injury.
things to avoid or consult medical advice beforehand are:
- rest in bed, avoid as pt with bed rest has developed more pain and slower recovery comparing to ambulatory patients.
- cold, sometimes used to reduce oedema however study results are inconsistent
- traction, no supportive evidence to suggest use
- lumbar supports, no therapeutic value
- paraspinal injections, little evidence and more related to other severe/long-term back pain, unlikely to be helpful in an acute setting

- have you used this medication before?
- how long have you been using this medication for?
- are you currently taking any other medications?
- do you have any medical conditions we should be aware of? (to gauge whether the patient has any cardiovascular risk factors).
we also ask the patient for their weight and height so that we can calculate their bmi and determine whether they are within the range to make them eligible for the supply of the product. it is important to undertake this process in a professional and tactful manner, so as not to offend anyone, as issues around weight can be a sensitive topic for some people.

"when patients come into the pharmacy requesting products to assist with sleep, there are a number of important questions to ask and things to check. as previously mentioned in many of the posts, there are many important questions to ask, such as determining what is the specific issue the patient is having with sleep and whether they have tried anything before.it is important to fully assess the sleep patterns and hygiene of the patient to determine whether the desired product, such as restavit, is appropriate and safe for the patient. pharmacists should use clinical judgement to determine whether treating the patient is within their scope of practice or whether the patient should be referred to a doctor. it is essential to ensure that the patient is aware that sleep aids are for short-term use only and to encourage them to address the underlying cause of their insomnia.

the most commonly requested sleep-aid products, including dozile and restavit are schedule 3 medications and thus, according to dpc regulation 143, must not be stored in a manner that allows self-selection by the public. (1) in most community pharmacies, this legislation is adhered to by having schedule 3 medications behind a counter that only the pharmacist or supervised staff can access. in line with the legislation, schedule 3 poisons should be kept in a way that does not promote their sale or draw undue attention to them. therefore s3 poisons are typically not stored in full view of customers.

"one of the lessons learned in this scenario pertains to correct dispensing processes. following guidelines for best dispensing processes, such as the pba, psa and pdl guides to dispensing, can help to provide consistency and minimise errors when dispensing. for example, the pdl guide to good dispensing outlines 7 stages to dispensing, such as checking patient and prescription details, computer input, selecting drugs off the shelf and in the computer system, labelling and checking the label, and doing a final check before confidently handing the product to the patient (including scanning) (1). following these guidelines is a good habit to get into when dispensing a product, and could be a positive change for future practice in order to minimise dispensing errors and enable ""good practice"".

additionally, as per the care principle 1 i.e. making the health and wellbeing of patients the first priority, it is important to give the correctly dispensed product to the correct patient every single time in order to prevent harm coming to the patient (2). therefore, keeping not just care principle 1, but also the psa code of ethics in mind when dispensing a product (as well as other dealings with patients) can ensure that your practice is in line with the ethical principles of pharmacy practice. in future, this can help by changing the outlook on dispensing and promoting a more careful and patient centred dispensing process to minimise errors and maximise the health and wellbeing of patients.

"hi caroline,
colchicine has found its way in the cardiac world for the treatment of acute pericarditis (and recurrent pericarditis). 
the american college of cardiology published an expert analysis on this last year. due to its anti-inflammatory effect, it has become favourable for this indication (1)!
cope (2) and icap (3) were 2 landmark trials investigating this. cope assigned 120 patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis to either aspirin (or corticosteroids if aspirin intolerant) and colchicine or aspirin alone. the combination therapy significantly reduced the rate of recurrence without any serious adverse events noted. icap assigned 240 patients to either placebo or colchicine. once again, the colchicine significantly reduced the rate of recurrence, the rate of hospitalisations and rate of symptoms present at 72 hours.
thanks,
diana

"2.outline non-drug advice you would provide linda and explain why you have chosen to manage her in this way?
firstly, i would apply/recommend the rice(r) first aid principle to linda for her calf strain.[1] this principle assists in the reduction of inflammation and allows the body to begin repairing itself.
r: rest for up to 48 hours. linda can still maintain some activity (eg. walking around), but should refrain from vigorous activity (like tennis) for up to 2 days.
i: apply ice or a cold pack to the calf for 10-20 minutes every 1-2 hours for up to 48 hours. the cold pack should not be placed directly onto the skin, so a cover or wet towel should be placed over the cold pack. icing the area will help limit inflammation and relieve some pain.
c: the area can be covered with a compression bandage if practical. this can be done for up to 48 hours.
e: linda should keep her leg elevated for as long as practical to reduce inflammation by assisting venous blood return.
r: i would refer linda to her gp and/or a physiotherapist. this is not only important to manage the current strain, but also to assist with the prevention of future injuries while playing tennis or other physical activity.
it is important to emphasise that heat or massage should not be used on the calf for the first 48 hours after the injury has occurred. these things promote blood flow to the area, which can increase inflammation.[1]

i would recommend kenalog in orabase paste (traimcinolone acetonide) which would help with the redness and inflammation. (1) as aarush is finding it very painful when eating, i would also recommend benzydamine 1% gel topically as a pain relief.( 1)
counselling points include:
-	apply the kenalog paste to the affected lesion 2-3 times daily after food.  ensure you press a small dab onto the lesion (around a 5 cent coin) until a thin film develops. (2) apply to clean fingertip and make sure you hold in the mouth for 1-2 minutes without swallowing, and then spit out excess.(1)  you can use a little more if the lesion is slightly bigger. ensure you dont rub it or spread it as it may cause a gritty sensation and the paste will crumble.(2)
-	if you experience any dizziness, weakness or further mouth ulcers in your mouth, stop the treatment and see a doctor.(2)
-	apply the benzydamine 1% gel topically to the lesions, 2-3 hourly as necessary. (1) 
-	ensure you rinse your mouth regularly after food before you apply the the paste. 
-	if pain is a big concern while eating, you can apply the benzydamine gel before you eat to help relieve the pain. (3)
-	generally, the side effects are minimal but some people may feel a stinging and burning sensation from the kenalog paste and a numbing sensation from the gel. (2)(3)
-	ensure you store both products in a dry, cool place away from heat and light. (3)

"hi,
i tend to agree with this idea that a health practitioners prior knowledge and experience of the use of risk assessment tools would have an influence on pressure injury risk assessment.  it is similar to many aspects in health; it is often hard to change ones practice and previous experiences do influence the practitioners clinical judgement.  
although risk assessments in general aim to alert practitioners to the most common factors that increase ones risk of developing a pressure injury (moore &amp; patton, 2019) and therefore, the practitioners previous experience using risk assessment tools should not be of negative influence when completing a pressure injury risk assessment.  however, there are still many factors that may be unique to a specific healthcare setting where the practitioners previous experience may influence clinical judgement and be detrimental.

"for acute lower back pain, the aim is normally to:
- reduce pain
- restore and maintain physical function
- minimise disability and absence from work
- reduce risk of the pain becoming chronic

in the acute phase of lower back pain, minimal intervention is normally needed (1). patient education, and reassurance of favourable prognosis is normally used (1).

some treatments that can be beneficial include thermotherapy (hot and cold packs) and massage. there is not a lot of good quality evidence to support these forms of therapy however in the treatment of acute lower back pain (1). having an active lifestyle and exercising has been shown to improve symptoms and get people back to work quicker then simple bed rest (1). it is also beneficial to limit the activities that may have cause the lower back pain in the first place. this may include occupational therapy so that jobs which require repeated movements and manual or physical labour are not contributing to back pain.
finally, cognitive behaviour therapy may also have a role to play in acute back pain treatment. it is thought to help with adaptive behaviours that self manage the associated pain. commencing early on could help with the prevention of the condition persisting to a chronic level (1).
for benny, he is a brick layer which is normally a fairly physical manual labour job. i think he would benefit from thermotherapy in trying to relieve some of the pain he is having, he may also benefit from having an occupational therapist asses his work techniques and aim to provide assistance with lifting and reducing negative strain and load on his lower back. alternatively he may also benefit from increasing the muscles that support the back, including core strength, which can be done with exercises.

"according to a cochrane review, there is moderate evidence that emerged from a limited number of trials which suggests that heat wrap therapy provides a small short-term reduction in pain.(1) the evidence for using cold packs for lower back pain is not as well supported, however both hot and cold therapy need to be investigated further for more high-quality evidence.(1)
a heat pack applied to the lower back would increase the blood flow to the area which can relax muscle fibres to alleviate pain that may be caused by muscle tightness.(2) i would make sure to tell benny that if he uses a hot pack, it is important to cover it with a cloth or towel and not to place is directly on the skin to prevent burns.(2) i would also advise that he uses the heat pack for 15 to 20 minutes at a time.(3) if benny wishes to use an electric heating pad, i would also tell him to make sure he doesnt fall asleep while the heat pad is on to prevent any skin burns and to set an alarm within 20 minutes if he thinks there is a possibility of dozing off.(3)

"amy perry has moved to melbourne from the
uk with her husband and family. she has a four- year- old son, jake, and is 30
weeks pregnant. jake had all his
vaccinations up to 12 months of age in the uk, but then the family started travelling
and they are now settling in melbourne. 

2.
amy is concerned about childhood vaccinations for jake, as she had heard
immunisation is linked to autism. how will you explain the benefits of
vaccinating jake to amy? what resources could you provide her with? (alexandra)



hi amy, i understand you are concerned
about what you have heard but i can reassure you that there is no link and
that there are many benefits to vaccinating jake. 

vaccinations are a safe way to strengthen
the immune system so that when your body comes into contact with a virus it can
help fight against it so that you do not
get sick or get a less severe illness, and avoid the most dangerous effects of
the illness (which can sometimes be life-threatening).(1) vaccines produce an immune
response in the body when administered but do not cause illness because the
virus in the vaccines is dead or very weak. your body creates antibodies to protect you from future
exposure to the virus as it will remember it has been exposed to it safely
through the vaccine. these antibodies will work to destroy the virus when you
come into contact with it again.(1)immunisation not only protects your child
from severe infectious diseases, but it is also
good for the community. as the more people who are vaccinated the less chance
of disease spreading. this called herd immunity, which you may have heard of. herd
immunity is important to safeguard vulnerable people who cannot be immunised
for some medical reason (for example a weakened immune system) or they are too
young.(2)

the more people vaccinated the higher
chance of getting rid of diseases in the community, state and country wide of
australia, which protects us all as a society.

it will also allow jake to be enrolled at a
childcare or kindergarten service, due to the no jab, no play rule.(3)

some resources you can access include the
better health channel (https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/immunisation-childhood), the australian government department of health national immunisation
program and how does immunisation work? (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule,

hi everyone! i'm florence,0,F,INDONESIAN
"i believe counselling over the phone or via email may present a variety of problems for the patient in terms of how the patient interprets and understands the information given to them by the pharmacist compared to counselling in person.  firstly, the conversation over the phone may not be clear in terms of clarity, sound, volume or connection and crucial points that the patient must know about methotrexate may be not delivered clearly and interpreted well by the patient. other things to note in regards to counselling over the phone is that it is extremely hard for the pharmacist to determine whether the patient has fully understand what has been conveyed to them as the pharmacist is unable to tell what facial expressions the patient may be having at the time of conversation, whether the patient is preoccupied with other tasks or whether the patient is actually listening to every word the pharmacist is saying to them. another problem is that patients may just respond 'yes' to understanding what has been conveyed to them, when in actual fact there may be several things that the patient has not fully understood or they may be too afraid/shy/embarrassed/disinterested etc. to address these issues with the pharmacist over the phone and may choose to address these issues other time, which may be not addressed with the gp/pharmacist later. in terms of email, the pharmacist has no way of checking whether the patient has actually read or opened the email unless the email program the pharmacist uses is able to determine whether the receiver has opened the email via read receipts. however, in terms of the patient reading the email, it is extremely hard to check and follow up on given the amount of tasks a pharmacist has to perform each day and not every patient will reply to each email sent to them and call up the pharmacy if there are any issues.  hence, i believe having a video call with the patient, paying a home visit to the patients home or calling the patient to see whether a close family member/carer/spouse can come in the pharmacy will be much more beneficial than counselling over the phone or via email. if technology permits and the patient is willing to receive a video call, this will save the patient from coming into the pharmacy but at the same time will assist the pharmacist in seeing whether:  - whether the patient is familiar with how to take methotrexate (once a week on the same day) - whether the dose, strength, quantity prescribed by the doctor is accurate  - what the treatment plan arranged by her doctor is  - whether her current treatment regimen has been going well (in other words, check for compliance) and whether there have been any recent changes in therapy - whether she is experiencing any adverse side effects (nausea, vomiting, unusual bleeding, nephrotoxicity, etc.) (1) - whether she is taking folic acid supplementation (due to methotrexate suppressing folic acid utilisation in the body) and if so, when does she take her folic acid and does she take her folic acid in the middle of the week following her methotrexate dose all the above points and any other relevant counselling points can be covered thoroughly in a home visit if the patient agrees for this service to be performed by the pharmacist or if the patient is willing for this information to be conveyed to a close family member/carer/spouse but it is best that the patient is the person who receives this information first-hand as the patient will be the person who will actually take the methotrexate and be subject to its pharmacological effect on the body and its associated side effects.

"hi annie, thanks for your question, generalization in research is an important question to answer. the research article by durmaz et al.(2012), was a study done to compare the effect of unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin on healing of skin wounds on rats. i found it difficult to find information on why we use rats in research even though they have been used in research for a long time. some information that i did find suggested that as rats are mammals and share similar anatomical, physiological and genetics to humans (iannaccone &amp; jacob, 2009). however, it is suggested that rodents heal more by contraction whereas humans heal by depositing granulation tissue and reepithelialisation (grada, mervis &amp; falanga, 2018; nuutila et al., 2016; parnell &amp;volk, 2019). pigs are more similar to humans however they come at a higher cost to researchers compared to rats (parnell &amp;volk, 2018). in the research by durmaz et al.2012) we would assume that the rats were absent of disease process and that full thickness wounds were created by the researchers. can this be generalised to the wider population? well it can if they are healthy (without disease process) and not receiving any other medications and are only receiving heparin or enoxaparin injections daily and the wound is a full thickness incision or biopsy. it cant if they are on other medications or have other disease processes that may affect healing. many wounds are caused by pathological processes that may be difficult to replicate in animal models (grada et al., 2018; parnell &amp;volk, 2019). however, the research results by durmaz et al. (2012) would potentially allow further research possibly on humans to be carried out. references durmaz, c. e., ozkan, a., senel, b., &amp; uyar, h. a.

"the initial dosage of opioid for breakthrough pain is recommended to be calculated based on  1/6th to 1/12th of the total daily opioid dosage [1, 2].  
in the case of nancy, based on her background opioid usage of fentanyl 100 microg patch her initially calculated breakthrough dose would have been: 
100mg morphine: 1 mg td fentanyl 
daily fentanyl dose = 100 microg x 24 = 2,400 microg = 2.4 mg
240 mg morphine: 2.4 mg td fentanyl
bt: 1/6th to 1/12th total daily dose = 20-40 mg morphine prn = 4-8mg hydromorphone prn 
potential for incomplete cross-tolerance also would need to be taken into account, allowing for a dose reduction of 50-75%  2-6mg hydromorphone prn 
this dosage however should then be titrated and individualised to the patient however [3], thus given nancy is now reporting the breakthrough doses are not working well enough the dose should be reviewed and uptitrated.  therefore it would be reasonable to increase the dosage range to 4-8mg hydromorphone ir q1h prn.  if breakthrough pain is not relieved after three consecutive hourly breakthrough doses then the background dose should be reviewed [1].  nancy would also need to be monitored for adverse drug effects with the higher dosage, in particular sedation and the dose reduced if required.

"thank you vannessa for providing us the information on clinical intervention. loved how simply you explained it to us. i would like to add these details.
 5.what is a clinical intervention? when and how would you report this? give an example of a clinical intervention made in your workplace. one of the main duties for pharmacists in the medication management cycle is the identification, resolution and/or prevention of drug related problems which is referred to as clinical intervention. delivering clinical interventions is an integral part of a pharmacist's daily practice.
 when and how to report clinical intervention:
the aim for clinical intervention
  selecting management options wisely  choosing suitable medicines if a medicine is considered   necessary using medicines safely and effectively according to psa guidelines, these can be obtained by medication review, dispensing and counseling the patient in regard to the prescription as well as non prescription medicines.

clinical interventions may be made and should be documented in following scenarios
  potential over use or duplication of medications  poor management of the medical condition   possible side effect of prescription medication for example when a customer asks for a non-prescription pain relief which can be for myopathy because of taking hmg co reductase inhibitors (statins)  identifying previously dispensed incorrect prescription from another pharmacy  when a consumer requests further information relating medicine and disease management.
clinical interventions can be made by any of the following ways using the templates given in psa website:
  using the paper based template   referral letter  documenting clinical notes and mrp using soap format and classification notes method of documenting:the following classification underlined by psa should be practiced while documenting any mrp:
d: drug selectiono: over or underdosec: : complianceu: undertreatedm: monitoringe: educationn: not classifiablet: toxicity/adrs
soap notes
ssubjective: summary statement from the patient and/or carer describing any symptoms they might be experiencing and their perception of the situation. oobjective: observations based on the perceptions of the pharmacist and signs that are seen or measured by the pharmacistaassessment: observations of the situation based on the subjective and objective observations; may include a tentative diagnosis or summation of the issue and identification of mrps. pplan: details for resolving the mrp, which forms the basis of the recommendations made by the pharmacist to the patient or prescriber.


example
cefalexin 125 mg four times a day is prescribed for a child who weighs 30 kg. the pharmacist contacts the prescriber, who approves an increase in dose to 190 mg four times a day.  mrp category: prescribed dose too low (o2)  recommendation(s): dose increase (r1); refer to prescriber (r9)  drugs involved: cefalexin
clinical notes:

"jane - why is physical health monitoring required in this patient group?
physical health monitoring is important for this group as taking anti-psychotic medications can cause metabolic changes in the patient. 
weight gain is a common side effect experienced when taking such medications, as with weight gain increased risk of t2dm occurs in this patient group. therefore monitoring bgl and waist circumference can pick up on metabolic changes early. (1)
it is also said the importance of measuring bp in this patient group, as identifying and potential issues early can help with ongoing management and reducing further cardiovascular risks. (1)

"hi parnaz and darshana and thanks for your comments - my apologies for my late reply! it has been a very long week!
so i had a chat to one of our pharmacists that was involved in writing our guideline and they said it is very common to see nac used in liver failure not associated with paracetamol. it is used at the dose recommended in our guideline even for patients that do not have alcohol related disease. after this discussion, i think i'll change my answer and say i will recommend what's in our guideline instead (like you said darshana, this is probably what the specialists want). it would be interesting to hear their point of view and why they recommend a different dosage to these studies - maybe i'm missing some key bit of evidence?
one thing that my colleague mentioned was that nac infusions are quite safe and rarely cause adverse drug reactions. in response to your question parnaz, if the treating team wanted to extend the dosage duration i would be okay with this - especially if we were seeing improvements in lfts.",1,F,ENGLISH
"the bacteria karen is infected with is clearly not susceptible to flucloxacillin as she is still very unwell and the cellulitis has spread. furthermore, karen is most likely suffering from cholestatic hepatitis as a result of the flucloxacillin  which is inflammation of the liver causing a problem with bile transport resulting in her jaundice or yellowing around the eyes.(1)i would advise karen to not only cease the oral flucloxacillin due to the severe suspected liver reaction, but given after 48 hours of oral therapy she is not better but in fact worse, it would be appropriate to refer her to the hospital emergency department as she is likely to need iv antibiotic treatment for her cellulitis as well as monitoring of her liver enzymes and bilirubin.flucloxacillin iv would be contra-indicated with a history of cholestatic hepatitis associated with flucloxacillin therefore according to therapeutic guidelines for patients with immediate nonsevere or delayed nonsevere hypersensitivity to penicillins, cefazolin 2g intravenously, 8 hourly is a suitable alternative.(2) this advice applies to patients with cellulitis associated with two or more systemic symptoms but not associated with hypotension, septic shock or rapid progression of systemic features.(2) when systemic features have improved, switch to oral therapy; if systemic symptoms rapidly resolve, one or two doses of intravenous therapy may be sufficient.(2) a total duration of therapy of 5 to 10 days (intravenous + oral) is recommended.(2)other likely management strategies of cellulitis include:- analgesia for pain- treat other conditions (e.g. diabetes, tinea pedis, abscesses/ulcers etc).- avoid trauma to skin if prone to cellulitis (e.g. wear protective clothing whilst gardening)- keep skin clean/moisturised- prevent leg oedema (compression stockings and elevation of limbs)- if pt has recurrent cellulitis, they can use a low dose prophylactic phenoxymethylpenicillin1. australian medicines handbook [internet]. adelaide: australian medicines handbook pty ltd; 2020. flucloxacillin; [updated 2020 jan; cited 2020 mar 3]; [1 screen]. available from:https://amhonline.amh.net.au.acs.hcn.com.au/chapters/anti-infectives/antibacterials/penicillins/flucloxacillin2. etg complete [internet]. therapeutic guidelines ltd; 2019. cellulitis and erysipelas; [updated 2019 dec; cited 2020 mar 3]; available from:https://tgldcdp.tg.org.au.acs.hcn.com.au/viewtopic?topicfile=cellulitis-erysipelas&amp;guidelinename=antibiotic&amp;topicnavigation=navigatetopic#toc_d1e475",1,F,DARI
"hi everyone, my chosen medication to look at is aspirin.  aspirin class: salicylates use: analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory. aids in inhibiting blood clotting, thus small daily maintenance doses are an effective method of risk reduction for vascular and coronary thrombus. side effects: gi irritation, increased bleeding time, sensitivity. contra-indications: active peptic ulcer, bleeding tendency, severe hepatic dysfunction, 3rd -trimester pregnancy. precautions: low na diet (aspro clear), asthma, viral infection (children under 12 years and teenagers), severe renal disease, urticaria, gout, pregnancy and lactation. drug interactions: anticoagulants, hypoglycaemics, methotrexate, nsaids, antacids, frusemide (porta, 2018). i looked at a couple of articles relating to the use of aspirin in chronic wound healing and its use with minor surgery on this type of wound. there is a strong indication by darby and weller (2016) and sun et al (2017) that aspirin inhibits the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (cox-1, cox-2) thus blocking the synthesis of some stimulators of inflammation. darby and weller (2016) noted that aspirin can affect the signalling pathways activated by inflammatory mediators. blocking this pathway had an additional anti-inflammatory effect that was required for wound healing. although dose dependant, aspirin did demonstrate a positive repair effect. also being a platelet aggregation inhibitor, i looked at the effect aspirin had when minor surgery was required in chronic wounds, eg skin grafting. sun et al (2017) found the continuous use of aspirin, compared to no use or pre-operative cessation did not significantly increase the risk of bleeding or associated complications such as haematoma, necrosis or infection. overall the studies indicated that provided haemostasis was achieved during surgery when a patient was on aspirin, its continued use was recommended. references: porta, m. s. a.

"q3 -karen has come back to the pharmacy with obvious worsening of the cellulitis, as well as yellowing of her eyes. what seems to have happened is two things.1. the cellulitis is not sensitive to flucloxacillin, which was the appropriate empirical therapy for cellulitis.2. karen seems to be experiencing a common side effect of flucloxacillin known as jaundice, which is an increase in bilirubin causing body fluids, eyes and skin to have a yellow tinge. this is often caused by a derangement of liver enzymes and hepatic dysfunction.(2)in this situation i would recommend the patient to be going either back to the gp or to the hospital. i would be more inclined to send them to the hospital, as karen has already experienced treatment failure with flucloxacillin, and the cellulitis is rapidly worsening. assessment in ed and an acute medical ward would allow for an mcs screen to be done to find out the sensitivities of the infection to direct therapy appropriately. on admission to an acute ward or ed it is likely that karen would be started on iv antibiotics, potentially something broad spectrum due to treatment failure with flucloxacillin, or potentially even something with mrsa cover empirically such as vancomycin until sensitivities are known.q4-if karen had an immediate hypersensitivity to penicillins, an appropriate oral therapy would depend on whether or not karen was showing systemic features. the etg suggests the following:no systemic features cellulitis: (1)the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 800 / 160mg bd for 5 days or clindamycin 450mg tds for 5 days, for patients with suspected mrsa or with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin.systemic features cellulitis:(1)use vancomycin as per local protocols (often aiming for a trough dose of 15-20mg/l) for patients with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin. however, this therapy is iv and should be completed in hospital.as karen was discharged with oral antibiotics i will assume that she did not have systemic features. therefore, either bactrim forte or clindamycin would be recommended. the counselling for these medications are as follows:trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole: karen will need to take this medication twice daily, i would recommend with food to avoid any stomach upset, so breakfast and dinner would be ideal. this medication can cause karen to become more sensitive to the sunlight, meaning she may experience a rash or sunburn more easily on sun exposure, so it is good practice to cover up while on the medication and apply sunscreen. some people are also allergic to this medication, so karen will have to watch for allergic reaction symptoms, a slight rash can be common, however anything more serious she should seek medical attention - such as anaphylaxis, swelling of the lips or tongue etc. if karen was to notice that the yellowing of her eyes was not improving, if she notices pale stools or dark urine, or if her infection started to get worse, or a new infection presents, she should seek further medical attention. karen should finish the entire 5 day course. (3)clindamycin: karen will need to take this medication three times a day, i would recommend taking this with breakfast lunch and dinner in to improve compliance, however this medication can be taken on an empty stomach, karen just needs to find a way that best works for her. the main thing karen needs to worry about with this medication is if she notices she gets any diarrhoea she should consult her gp. if the diarrhoea is excessive, she should go to hospital as this could be indicative of a c.diff infection. again, karen should watch for any allergic reaction symptoms, and ensure she finishes the entire 5 day course.

my area of expert professional practice is neurology (particularly stroke patients) in a large tertiary metropolitan hospital, providing comprehensive clinical pharmacy services to adult patients. i am also responsible for the education and training of pharmacy colleagues within our department.
transition level - stage 1
i have worked as a member of a research team. i have been involved in auditing a systems based approach to deprescribing proton pump inhibitors (ppis) [e69-70]. being responsible in this study for the collection of data, i personally collected and was accountable for the data of 200 patients pre- and post-intervention of an electronic medication chart prescribing guide for medical staff. through the audit, we concluded there was a minor influence of the guide on prescribing. however, it did impact the clarity of documentation in discharge summaries, as well as identifying the need for further initiatives to improve deprescribing of ppis amongst medical staff. in addition, i had an active role in the antibiotic allergies in general medicine study [e75]. i collected patient data from personally interviewing inpatients on acute wards and collating their information into a unifying document for analysis. the study identified the high prevalence of antibiotic allergies amongst general medicine patients and its association with excessive and likely inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics[e75]. as a result of this study, it saw the introduction and implementation of the drug and antibiotic allergy service (daas) at austin health.

under the national law as a registered health practitioner, i have a professional and ethical obligation to protect the health of the public and ensure adequate and consistent health care is delivered (1). by committing this breach of conduct, i have mandatory notification to notify ahpra of the pharmacist's actions. i would allow the pharmacist to explain their reasoning behind taking the tablets and if it is a one of time may consider disciplinary action. as gai stated above, temazepam is an s11 medication therefore pdl and the police may have to also be notified.

today we discussed:

going online and what does that mean for our learning experience here at parkville.


covid-19 and panic buying: most affected are those who are vulnerable such as the elderly, people with disabilities and students living alone with no support.


ways to improve teamwork: it is important to allocate roles in a team and ensure that this allocation is even and plays to the strengths of members. note that sometimes with an online system there are issues that occur on a technical level that will hinder the teams performance like mics not working or internet connections dropping out. additionally, connecting as a group can have issues when people are using different platforms ie some on facebook and others on the discussion forum and neither can find each other on their respective platforms and so the group loses time to complete workshop tasks

for the second part of this online discussion i interviewed a wound resource education nurse (wren), who is involved in the auditing of hospital-acquired pressure injury (hapi) rates in their ward. this involves frequently monitoring incidence rates on a monthly basis to determine whether preventative interventions are implemented, specifically for high-risk patients. according to the wren, measuring hapi prevalence rates is a key element in the clinical risk management framework as it focuses on preventing patient harm, as well as serving as a basis to monitor quality improvement activities and interventions. as mentioned by the cnc, since the redesign of the hospitals approach in preventing hapis in 2013, the initiative to conduct monthly audits of hapis has resulted in a steady decline in hapi rates and has proven to have a positive impact in the safe delivery of patient care. the wren stated that whilst preventative measures are clinically effective in reducing the rates of hapis, competing patient demands and priorities are often the reason why compliance with preventative protocols of hapis are not being met. therefore, the role of the wren was essentially established to lessen the burden of the multi-faceted demands that frontline clinicians may face. once audits are completed, wrens are responsible in disseminating audit findings to the team and implement the necessary changes to improve patient outcomes.

challenges i predicted in this project is firstly this unpredicted outbreak of covid-19 causes a lot of delay in many areas. although my research can still carry out by searching for resources on the internet, i might still need the guidance from the supervisors. this is because face-to-face meeting is more limited now. to overcome this, we have reported our progress via email. hopefully, we can grasp the idea of the supervisor's guidance via email. another challenge might also be not having enough experience and knowledge in research. i do not know how much information is enough, or the information that i need is relevant or not, or am i heading the right direction. the plan to overcome this is report my progress to supervisors from time to time, making sure that it is a satisfactory report and making sure that i am heading to the correct direction.",0,M,MANDARIN

"l-methylfolate is the biologically active form of folate, whereas folic acid is a synthetic form. therefore, the benefit of taking l-methylfolate is that it does not need to undergo metabolism in the body to become active. folic acid however must undergo a number of steps in a metabolism cycle to be converted to l-methylfolate, i.e. the active form. furthermore, some individuals are unable to convert folic acid to l-methylfolate due to a mutation inmthfr, an important enzyme required in the last step in the folic acid metabolism cycle, thusl-methylfolate supplementation is beneficial in these patients.

"q: there is more evidence now for the use of antidepressants in the younger population. although fluoxetine is often the first choice - can you find some other antidepressants that may be recommended, with some evidence to support the choice. and those that should not? a: the other drug of choice would be escitalopram - currently this drug and fluoxetine are the only 2 antidepressants approved by fda for adolescents. (1) however, if fluoxetine failed and it's not helping, sertraline or citalopram may be used as a second line treatment by specialists with close monitoring. (1, 2) there is a randomised double blinded study suggest escitalopram was effective and well tolerated in adolescents suffering depression and significant improvent was seen in the escitalopram group than the pacebo group at endpoint in children's depression rating scale-revised score (cdrs-r score) over 8 weeks (22.1 versus 18.8, p = .022; last observation carried forward). (3) sertraline, citalopram and escitalopram are quickly metabolised by children and it is recommended to be used as twice daily. (1) nevertheless, citalopram may not be the most ideal drug to use due to qt prolongation and more toxic if overdose. (1) there's also another randomised double-blinded study suggested there is no significant improvement between citalopram and placebo group over 12 weeks. (4) there is still little evidence in regards to use of mirtazapine and it may be used when sleep is a problem. (5) there was an open-labelled study done in the past to support mirtazapine may be an effective treatment but more studies with larger size are needed to support this conclusion. (6) the ones which should not be used are paroxetine, venlafaxine, tca, agomelatine, mao inhibitors and st john's wort. (7)

"hello!
i am pretty sure there was no reply button this morning...",1,M,PORTUGUESE
"hi group b. im a bit late to the discussion (minor assignment 2 dilemmas) but have enjoyed reading your contributions. its like a mini pharmacology course related to wound healing! how fascinating that medications we assume are all negatively impairing wound healing, particularly pain (a known impairment to healing) with methotrexate and the antinflammatory properties for ""inflammatory"" wounds that steroids have positive effects on that suyi, elsie and rose discuss. it's such a fight out there balancing the mediators.  i chose the anticoagulant warfarin to investigate. warfarin has two main propriety names which are coumadin and mervan and although both are warfarin sodium, the tga states that they are not bioequivalent and therefore not interchangeable. a student paper by chen, wang, graudins &amp; hopper (2016) found that observational studies on using the two brands interchangeably showed an increase of complications however, it was recognised with close monitoring, using them interchangeably if necessary was preferable to withholding if a clients usual brand was not available.  warfarin sodium is a vitamin k dependant factor anticoagulant (mimsmobile). it's main indications are for treatment and/or prophylaxis of venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) and treatment of thromboembolic complications related to atrial fibrillation. it is also indicated for use in any coronary condition that may result in coronary occlusion. warfarin is contraindicated in anyone who has a physical (including personal hazard e.g. high falls risk) of haemorrhage which outweighs the clinical benefits of taking anticoagulants including haemorrhagic tendencies.  wigston et al (2013), state that warfarin directly negatively impacts on wound healing. given that haemostasis via coagulation and mediated by pdgfs and tgfs which are platelet driven is the earliest step in wound healing, any anticoagulant is going to interfere with this process (levine, 2017).  karukonda et al., (2000) describe specifically that warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin k necessary for the coagulation process. however, what is extremely interesting is that, due to the static blood flow in venous leg ulcers and subsequent endothelial damage and fibrin deposition, warfarin could have encouraging effects in this area. adversely there is a rare warfarin induced skin condition that causes necrosis (vyas, 2016) where there is contradictory blood clotting of vessels that can affect 1 in 10,000 of those prescribed warfarin. it usually presents in early commencement of warfarin therapy and is seen in areas with higher prevalence of fat. vyas (2016) also describes calciphylaxis as another form of necrosis seen induced by early introduction of warfarin, more associated with perimenopausal women or in those with chronic renal failure. it is caused by occlusion of blood vessels with calcium.  it is compelling that some of these drugs not only positively or negatively impact in wound healing but in some case, cause damage. i look forward to continuing the conversation.  references. chen, f., wang, i., graudins, l., &amp; hopper, i.

example 7.5 how far does the package in figure 7.4 coast after the push, assuming friction remains constant? 
use work and energy considerations.

the answer is 19.2m but when i use kinematic method to redo the calculation(assume the friction is constant)
vf= 0.5
v0= 2.53
a = f/m= -0.17m/s^2
and use the equation vf^2 = v0^2 + 2a(xf-x0)
xf = 18.09
why use different strategy will result in different answer?

2. such a large force (500 times more than the persons weight) over the short impact time is enough to break bones.
a much better way to cushion the shock is by bending the legs or rolling on the ground, increasing the time over which the force acts.

why bending the legs or rolling on the ground will increase the time over which the force acts?
how ?
i think the time doesnt change but the direction will change.

would you mind help me to address thses problems ?
i will appreciate your help

the oort cloud exists entirely in interstellar space however it maintains an orbit of the solar system just barely. 
there are many reasons i like the oort cloud. 

first, i really like the name and it is fun to say. 
another thing i like about the oort cloud is that it seriously dwarfs anything else in the solar system, 
it is believed to extend almost 3 light-years across which for an object that is part of the solar system is insane. 
one of my favourite things about the oort cloud is how mysterious it is. 
the oort could has never been observed and it is highly difficult to do so as it is so far away and has an extremely low density with all of that area only culminating to a suspected 5 earth masses. 
both voyager i and ii's systems will have long been shut down before they reach the oort cloud. 
another thing i really like about the oort cloud is how encompassing it is. 
unlike other solar objects the outer oort could is believed to be spherical rather than a ring, 
the thought of being completely surrounding by something we can't see of interact with is extremely fascinating.

"hey shaun :),
the developmental window hypothesis suggests that species with smaller offspring are favored by selection pressures at higher latitudes, as unlike larger offspring, they have enough time to fully develop.  so, your first suggestion is correct.

for your second question, im not sure when i said that the small egg sizes in turtles were themselves a constraint, i mightve gotten tongue tied and misspoken.  
i mightve meant that  smaller windows of higher temperatures were more of a constraint on turtle development than smaller egged animals like fish or amphibians, maybe?  
to answer the main thrust of your question, however, im not sure how much it will end up coming up in the study im undertaking.  
it will definitely figure to some degree into the discussion that will be had about whether the trends set by turtles are followed by the other reptile groups and why it is or isnt the case.  
the prominence that it takes will probably be down to the papers i end up finding after data collection is finished and im pulling out my hair trying to find an explanation for the results .  
if the other reptiles dont follow the trends that the turtles did, then i will probably end up looking for similarities between them and the other non-turtle-trend-following groups.
this would probably end up leading to a discussion about common selection pressures faced by other reptiles and these non-turtle-trend-following groups.  

if turtles and other reptiles do follow the same trends yep, id still end up discussing the shared selection pressures they face that are different to the other groups.  
so, yes the selection pressures faced by other groups will come up in the discussion.  to what extent and how, im not sure yet.

task 2
for shifting the behaviour of monash students, 'norms' could be used as a driver. the students of this era lean towards trends. by adapting to the ever changing trends in the world they always keep on adapting to them. often their source of influence is friends. similarly, encouraging the students who use the bicycles in campus can be asked to be ambassadors of the same and might encourage other students to follow them.

"        what are the main threats to biodiversity?
the main driver of extinction and species diversity is extensive land use change. climate change and invasion of exotic species are other major drivers of biodiversity threat anticipated to increase over the next few years. human activities cause substantial disruption to the resilience within species but often go unattended. the consequential evolutionary mismatch of the environments in which species now exist have a negative effect on species. as such, this unwanted evolution requires rigorous and innovative management practices that carefully address the threats to biodiversity. 

        are current conservation practises sufficient to mitigate/manage these threats?
current conservation practices emphasise on environmental conditions and phenotypes such as vaccines to improve survival. however, these approaches rarely include a prescriptive evolutionary aspect within them. most large bodied conservation initiatives heavily focus on genetic diversity and inbreeding avoidance without incorporating prescriptive evolution as a method of recovery. 

        do we need to change how we manage biodiversity?
with species declining at an alarming rate, there is a greater need for a radical approach that can rescue declining populations. captive breeding programs aimed at saving threatened species pose a risk of exposure to diseases, inbreeding and as a whole are non-sustainable approaches. most conservation practices typically focus on conserving and preserving populations that are already under server threats however, evolutionary threats are better managed when signs are predicted early on. therefore, sophisticated monitoring that focus on early warning signs are of utmost importance. 

        how do we go about changing conservation practise? 

conservation practices may be modified in several ways: 
        conservation practices can gain a surplus amount of benefits from the incorporation of evolutionary approaches. technological innovations such as next generation sequencing enable accurate analysis of genetic diversity and can potentially limit declining populations. evolutionary impact statements that assess genetic data and studying habitat changes in an effort to create reserve areas that aim to slow the genetic diversity losses. 

        the development of a framework that monitors and addresses early evolutionary decline signs 

        a stronger advocacy for policy to incorporate the importance of genotypic and phenotypic variation into protected areas and climate change mitigation designs.

"i believe that water activity is the most important factor for food safety.
water activity (aw) refers to the availability of water molecules to microbes for use in metabolic processes. 
water molecules may be found either in a free state or bound to molecules and hence unavailable to microorganisms to use.  
most spoilage organisms have an optimal growth point when the aw of a food is around 0.9, however many won't grow when the aw value is lower than 0.85. 
as a result, this point is where a food would be considered a potentially hazardous food (phf).  
an aw of 0.6 is the point at which moulds and yeasts can no longer grow, 
while an aw value of 0.2 inhibits the activity of microbial enzymes responsible for degradation, slowing down the process of spoilage in foods.  
adjusting the aw of a food is relatively easy, with the addition of salt or sugar binding large amounts of water molecules and making them unavailable for microbial growth. simply drying a food also lowers the water content and slows the rate at which spoilage organisms can multiply.",1,F,ENGLISH
"hi guys
this is my summary ofthe relationship between wavelength, frequency and speed of light.
wave nature of light
light is classified as a transverse wave as its movement is perpendicular to the direction of the wave.

this diagram highlights the key points on a wave
wavelength: the distance, measured in the direction of travel of a wave, between two crests or troughs at the same phase.
crest/peak: the top or highest part of a transverse wave.
trough: the bottom or lowest part of a transverse wave.
amplitude: the absolute value of the maximum displacement from a zero value to crest point
period: the time interval taken to complete one cycle
period and frequency are related where period is inversely related to frequency ;
t(s)= 1/f(hz)
wave equation derivation
velocity = distance / time = distance of one wavelength(lamda)/t
frequency = 1/t
the relationship becomes v=f x(lamda)
v= m/s
f= hz
lamda = meters (m)

the same equation applies for speed of light

the idea that life can distributed through space aboard meteors and comets from planet to planet is the panspermia theory. 
it suggests that life did not originate on earth rather it was transported to earth from elsewhere in the universe. 
few arguments support this theory which have led researchers to dive more into this hypothesis.

first evidence of life on earth found is believed to be approximately 3.83 billion years old which falls in the timeframe of the very powerful and prolonged series of meteors showers on earth. 
however, for life to exist elsewhere in the universe, it needs to be on another planet which has capable enough environment to support life. 
evidences support this too like mars is believed to have contained water in the past. 
also, number of microbes exist/grow in extreme conditions (relative to earth) makes it hard to believe that life is unique to earth. one of jupiter's moons may have underground oceans.
further more, numerous organic compounds like amino acids (building blocks of proteins) have been found on meteoroids which have fallen into the earth.

"emission line spectra occurs when the electrons who are excited (a greater orbital energy than it is naturally) return to their ground state, in the process they emit light with specific wavelengths and frequencies creating a spectrum. in addition, in the process while an electron moves from its excited state back to its ground state, the electron can emit different wavelengths and frequencies as it the drop does not have to be immediate and direct. for instance an electron at n=3 can go via n=2, then n=1 to return to its ground state or n=3 straight to n=1. an absorption spectrum is represented by black lines, this where photons absorb packets of energy to go from a ground state to an excited state. however, the amount of energy absorbed must be the exact difference between two energy levels, otherwise the electron will not become excited and a black line won't be visible in the spectrum.

amounts of honey sugars such as fructose, glucose and sucrose were determined using the perkin elmer 200 series high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) with ri-detector. the honey sugars were identified and quantified through comparison of the retention times and the peak area of the honey sugars with those of the standard sugars. the mass percentage of the sugars was recorded as g/100 g.


gelatin was dissolved in phosphate buffer at a ratio of 1:100 (gelatin: buffer). it was homogenised using an ultra turrax homogenizer at 9000 rpm for 3 minutes. then using sorvall legenda xtr (refrigerated centrifuge) the homogenate was centrifuged at 9000 x g for 15 minutes at 4o c. the total nitrogen content was determined and the value was multiplied by a factor of 5.8 to determine the protein content. it was then expressed as a percentage of the total gelatin.


test was carried out at 22o c and external plastic case was discarded off the cooked sausages. ta. xt2i sms stable micro systems texture analyser with the texture expert programmes was used during the testing. for each sample, four 1.5 cm high and 2 cm wide cylinders were prepared. a double compression cycle test was performed up to 50% compression of the original portion height with an aluminium cylinder probe of 2 cm diameter. a time of 5 seconds was allowed to elapse between the two compression cycles.


how is the sample prepared and treated to induce a change in the property?


5 g of honey sample was dissolved in 40 ml water and 25 ml of methanol which was added into a 100ml volumetric flask. the solution was transferred to the flask and made to the mark with water (35 ml).


gelatin samples were separately dissolved in phosphate buffer (ph 7.5), 50 mm containing different concentrations of sodium chloride (02.0 m).


external casing was removed and discarded from cooked sausages and stored at 5o c until analysis.


what is property is measured and what are the units of measurement?



the sugar profile to determine the type of sugar in the honey samples. the unit of measurement is g/100g.


the solubility of protein is measured as a function of sodium chloride concentration and the unit of measurements is %.


the properties measured and the unit of measurement were the maximum force required to compress the sample: hardness, n (newton), the ability of the sample to recover to the original form after deforming force was removed: springiness, m (metre), area under the abscissa after the first compression: n s (newton second) and extent to which the sample could be deformed: cohesiveness.


what is the experimental result compared with? eg, a sample control, a positive control or standard or reference material?


it was compared to pure standard sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose) that were purchased from sigma chemicals located in germany.


as this experiment is testing solubility from the skin of indian major carps (fish) the sample control is an already known material used to make gelatin, porcine.


the results are compared against each other as 3 different types of sausages were being examined.


is the data empirical or absolute? can the data be compared with other published data or only relative to a reference sample?


the data is absolute and can be compared to other published data. this is because there is already previous research that provides evidence of honeys from other botanical and geographical origins.


the data is absolute. the results can be used as relative to a reference material as the amount of protein content extracted varies on the procedures used (centrifuge brand, type, timing and speed).


the measure of each parameter studied is absolute, however the methods used to prepare the sausage may limit the data ability to be compared with other published data.


are there any other considerations that could affect the comparability of the data with similar published data?


no, because the date is following guidelines and protocol set by the international honey commission, it should not pose as an issue to anyone wanted to compare the data to other publications.


yes. the amino acid content differs between each sample used and also the centrifugation conditions and timing varies both having an effect on the amount of protein measured and should be taken into considerations when comparing data.


yes, although you may be able to purchase sausages called chopped, mortadella and galantines the seasoning and preparation may vary, this means that results may not be comparable.

"hi aiden, thanks!
i think i might have struggled to do justice to that explanation in my talk.  the smaller-egged offspring of fish, amphibians and invertebrates would take (generally) less time to develop than turtle eggs.  this would (generally) occur because for larger offspring to finish development, more cell division and growth would be required.  (i havent done a full on dive into the literature to investigate this relationship, so i could be wrong here).   if an animal takes less time to develop, they could make do with a shorter period of the temperature they need for development.  an egg requiring more time to develop may not be able to complete development in the same window of adequate heat that a smaller egg could complete development in.  
this difference in developmental time may not be as pronounced when eggs are more similar in size.  while an egg 1 mm across is half the size of a 2mm across egg, the difference in offspring size is quite small, compared to that of larger eggs (say a 5cm long egg and a 7cm long egg).  a wider range in egg sizes would make it more likely that there will be larger eggs that wont be able to complete development in the window given.  for smaller sized eggs, with smaller sized differences, it would be more likely for both eggs to be able to complete development in the small window given.  
also i feel (yet again, i havent done the research) that windows of periods of suitable temperatures could only get so small while still allowing a sustainable number of the animals to reproduce.  while a certain animal might only take a couple of days for eggs to hatch and larvae to develop, the population might still need more time to produce enough offspring for the it to persevere.  if that is the only period of time given to the species to reproduce, theyd either need to have highly synchronized reproductive schedules, or youd have a whole bunch of time where individuals that missed the chance wont be able to contribute to the next generations population.  this could result in groups that only require short windows being generally ok in windows of similar sizes, unlike species requiring larger windows.  
i hope some of this helped, shoot me a message if ive missed anything or youd like to discuss it further.

the lab sheet says it's an observation of 9 consecutive days but wouldn't it make more sense if we counted the days as the time between movements? eg if we take the former approach then io has an obrital period of 3 days while the latter gives an orbital period of 2. the latter makes more sense to me because considering the starting point of our count to be 1 day doesn't seem right but the question claims it's a 9 day observation.

i just wanted to add to molly's excellent description of black hole identification. the first ever black hole identified is more than 50 million light years away: messier 87, an enormous black hole thought to be the same mass as 6.5 billons suns! black holes not only can be identified by the orbiting of surrounding stellar objects, but by the radiation they give off. i have had a bit of trouble wrapping my head around this, but i'll give it my best shot.as black holes consume matter surrounding them, they also release strong jets of hot plasma containing electrons.the electrons and other particles then travel close to the speed of light and shoot off into the event horizon, getting pushed outward along the axis of rotation of the black hole. these particles emit light we can see in telescopes. this process is still under research.

luminosity is the total amount of energy from all wavelengths that a star emits a second. apparent brightness is the amount of energy that reaches a given area on earth. apparent brightness follows the inverse square law therefore for a star twice as far as way from earth than any other given star it would need to have a luminosity four times greater thus making apparent brightness dependent on how far the object emiting energy is from the observer. the key different between luminosity and apparent brightness is that luminosity measures the total amount of energy emitted whilst apparent brightness measures the total energy received on earth,1,M,ENGLISH

"after learning about how the corona technically encompasses the earth, i did some research about the phenomenon known as the heliosphere. the heliosphere is the vast region of space where solar activity can be seen. this bubble of sorts extends beyond earth and encompasses the entirety of the solar system and even beyond pluto, until it meets the point of termination shock, where the matter and radiation that exists between star systems impedes it to the point of complete standstill at the heliopause. the heliosphere forms a natural barrier against galactic cosmic rays that are harmful to human life.
earth itself has been known to exert a heliosphere itself due its own dynamo and protects the atmosphere from erosion.without this heliosphere, evolution of life would not have occurred and we would have likely ended up in a similar state as mars or venus. this also applies to the heliosphere around the solar system; without the heliosphere, lethal radiation would be able pass through at a rate in which our heliosphere cannot combat it which would eventually result in the destruction of earth. such a phenomena also is a testament to how precise the conditions for life are. due to the sun average in size, it is capable of generating a large enough heliosphere to impede cosmic rays, but is also small enough so that it's own cosmic rays aren't as strong relative to the interstellar radiation.",1,M,MANDARIN

"hey guys :) i'm going to be discussing the seasons on mars and how they differ to earth.  as we know earth has four seasons with each lasting approx. 3 months. the reason behind this is due to the tilt of the earth and its journey around the sun, which takes around 365 days to complete. in short, mars still experiences four distinct seasons. however, it is farther away from the sun and therefore must travel longer to complete one full orbit. a difference in axial tilt (25 degrees as opposed to earth's 23.5) and a year lasting 687 days means its seasons tend to be almost twice as long as we experience. a little bit of information regarding the types of seasons on mars: - mars orbits closest to the sun when the southern hemisphere is tilting towards it, and therefore the southern summer is far hotter than the northern summer. this additional incoming heat causes strong winds and often great turbulent storms (i've attached a photo which depicts what it would look like).  - the southern hemisphere spring is warmer (as it is tilted closest to the sun as it enters into summer) and shorter in comparison to the northern hemisphere spring (it is further out from the sun during the northern spring) (it can be a little confusing to understand and explain but ive attached some images that might hopefully help).  - given mars does have such a lopsided orbit, the northern hemisphere autumn (and thus a southern hemisphere spring) is actually the planets shortest season.  - a martian winter is extremely cold, with temperatures potentially reaching down to -125 degrees c.  also just a little break down on how long each season lasts (this is for the northern hemisphere): - spring = 7 months - summer = 6 months - autumn = 5.3 months  - winter = a little over 4 months  finally, i just wanted to add there are two important terms which i came across a lot whilst researching this topic: aphelion and perihelion. aphelion is when mars is at its farthest point from the sun, whilst perihelion is when the planet is at its closest point. earth has these as well! ive attached some images which will hopefully visually explain these ideas a bit better.  sarah :)

"as we look deeper into the sun, it gets denser and denser, thus increasing in pressure. it is known that gases flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. using this principle, it can be seen that there is a force due to pressure within the sun, pushing outwards. this opposes the force of gravity which will eventually cause it to collapse. throughout the sun's lifetime, these opposing forces will be equal in magnitude, creating a hydrostatic equilibrium, which allows the sun to remain stable.
the sun is powered by a process called stellar nucleosynthesis, which is based around nuclear fusion. in the dense and hot centre of the sun, light elements are fused together to create heavier ones. energy is required to separate atoms into protons, neutrons and electrons, known as binding energy, which is different for each element. when lighter atoms are fused into heavier ones, the difference in binding energies results in vast amounts of energy being released, which powers the sun. currently, and over most of its lifetime, the sun will fuse hydrogen into helium, producing this energy. however, as the sun begins to run out of hydrogen, it will burn and therefore create heavier elements as it slowly dies.",1,M,ENGLISH

"the innermost layer of the sun is the core, which is one of the hottest region of the sun reaching tempretures of about 15 million kelvin. it's extremely dense and the majority of nuclear fission occurs here which produces a star's light and heat energy. directly above the core is the radiative zone, which is where the heat energy generated in the core is distributed through to the outer layer.. it takes a while for this energy to pass through the radiative zone though, as it's very dense layer of atoms means photons frequently collide with these atoms, disrupting the path energy takes out towards the surface of the sun. the next layer is the convection zone, and is the outer layer of the sun. plasma (extremely hot ionised gases e.g hydrogen, helium) rises through this layer to release its heat energy into outer space, and then this hot gas falls down to the inner depths of the convection zone to be reheated, effectively creating a convection current. 
in terms of atmospheric layers, the innermost is the photosphere, which is the most visible layer as photons generated deep within the core of the sun can finally be released into the sun (hence photo-sphere) with the surrounding densities of atoms being far lower than the previous layers. the photosphere consists of many 'granuels' of plasma spread throughout, along with sunspots which are cooler regions of plasma that are prevented from falling due to gravity. the chromosphere is directly above above, and is rich in hydrogen, and is also hotter than the photosphere. combined with the transition region, the heat from the photosphere is transferred to the corona creating burst of extremely hot tempretures up to a million kelvin.",1,M,ENGLISH

"hi mohammed,
i believe the range formula, r = (v^2*sin(2theta)) / g , found in ch3 page 113, is the best to go about this problem. 
inputting r = 7m and v = 12m/s, i solved for an angle of 14.22degrees.
for part b) and c), i worked towards both of these simultaneously. using the formula t = r / v*cos(theta) , i inputted both 14.22 degrees and 75.78degrees (90.00 - 14.22) into this and ended with 0.60s and 2.37s, respectively. 
answering the question of why we take the first angle, is partly due to the second answer we solved, 2.37s, seems rather unreasonable given the parameters set by the question. alongside this, i also think because we were originally solving for theta in part a), thus the answer we obtain will be given anti-clockwise from the positive x-axis (in this instance, can also be viewed as the ground) which will be 14.22degrees.
hope this makes sense, and please let me know if this is correct thinking !

"hi michael,
i have a lot of questions about the assignment and figured its best to post here since everyone else will se the response since i know most of us have the same questions and confusions.

1.question 1: most of us are getting magnitudes that are 2-5 off the actual values. is this ok? we are unsure if we have done the aperture photometry wrong or if the equation you have given us will produce these kind of errors because not all of the calibration terms are included. should we be worried about this or just move on? and if we should be worried can we get some feedback/help on what we might all be doing wrong.

2. question 3: is worth 4 marks for one equation, is this just generous? no tricks?

3. question 4: my plot for this looks like the following, is this somewhat ok?

4. question 5: i do not understand how we are meant to determine anything other than ""my object is blue or red"" from a 5 point scatter plot. wouldnt ""red n dead"" and ""dusty and star forming"" look the same? also we cant resolve the 4000a break so that does not help us. i have tried looking online to see if there are some comparison plots using this method and i cant find anything so i am struggling to interpret this beyond yes its red = old.

5. question 10: i dont have a h beta emission line, it does not exist for my galaxy. should i just say the ratio is 1:0? and then discuss or am i meant to measure it? i have a very flat line, see picture below.


6. question 12: i do not think any of us have been able to open the downloadable table and thus we can not progress in the assignment. if possible can you provide instructions on how to download and open the file in python? ive spent 2 hours trying to figure this out without any luck. (i also think i have now read every post on stack exchange). i cant download the file from the webpage and copying/pasting the data messes up the format so i am not to sure how we are meant to do this.

thank you for the feedback!
in figure 3 and 4, the different shapes represent all the different outdoor mesocosms (we had 30 in total). that's why there's so many different shapes. the important thing to note from this figure is that all the mesocosms under the fast, slow and control conditions exhibited trends common to each condition (fast produced frogs with low body weight, while slow was slightly higher and control higher still). this is more relevant that what any individual mesocosm (shape) was doing.

"hey everyone, although this was a difficult practical and there were many confusing concepts, that lead to many miscalculations. however, it was physical representation of kepler's and newton's laws, and the practical use of them in everyday astronomy.  below are a few of my thinking processes as i complete this practical! 1. in observing the the orbits of the moons, the observer was looking at them from a side on view. therefore, the clear nature of the moon's orbits around jupiter is not clearly known (even though according to kepler's laws that orbits are elliptic). however, for example, by looking at the orbital range of the moon callisto, it is evident that callisto is at the same distance from the jupiter on day 1 and day 9 (when its half way through its orbit). this goes for all the other galilean moon's. therefore, i think it would be to assume for this practical that the moon's orbits are circular in nature. 2. according to kepler's laws, that the square of a planet's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its furthest point in its orbit. this is supported, by the differencebetween europa's orbit, compared to callisto's orbital period. since europa is the closest moon to jupiter, it experiences a stronger gravitational attraction from the magnetic field from jupiter. hence, it orbits at a greater speed around jupiter, and has much shorter orbital period. in comparison to callisto, which experiences a weaker gravitational attraction to jupiter and moves much more slowly around its orbit. hence, the moon's nearest jupiter have a shorter orbital period than those further out.
3. underestimations of the actual mass of jupiter: this can be linked to the fact that jupiter, is actually one of the focus point, not the centre, of the elliptical orbits that determines the orbits of the moon. hence, this would of lead many people to overestimate the length of the semi-major axis. thus, contributing to many underestimations of the weight of jupiter. 4. part c: the equation for the centre of mass is defines such as that: m1r1 = m2r2. for this reason this task to be completed, was that in-order to find the centre of mass we needed to know the masses of both pluto and charon. however, we could not find the masses (besides looking it up), without the centre of mass calculation. hence, this was a very confusing loop hole, that could not be solved with the information provided. however, it would be clear that pluto would have the greater mass, since the centre of mass is closer to pluto, indicating a stronger magnetic field. than charon which is smaller and much less dense. these are just my thought. kind regards, luke cranswick",1,M,ENGLISH
