"ever since childhood, i had a keen interest when it came to crime stories. the amateur interest became quite serious when i actually started reading newspapers and watch news just for the sake of crime related content.

i remember the first case that shocked me and made me tilt more towards crime stories was the nirbhaya rape case that became a landmark and held the entire india shocked. the case got international coverage since women safety was at stake as a girl was raped brutally by 4 men, one juvenile in the running bus in new delhi. not just raped, she was assaulted to an extent that even doctors could not have imagined. several candle march and protests exhibited outrage of people.
this case in particular, had a very deep impact on me as a person. i myself went for protests and got to know a lot about the case through various sources like podcasts, books and mainstream media reports.

crime stories help me in knowing the absolute unpredictable human mind, the extent to which it can cause damage. people murdering, raping, causing serious harm for petty reasons forced me to think upon the reason why these crimes actually happened.

back in india, i usually watched news channel- aajtak, news24, indiatv. certain shows like crime patrol where they enacted the murder scenes, giving it a dramatic turn in a documentary form also fascinated me.
here, i have started reading top newspapers like heraldsun to gain some insight on serious crimes. 

the one thing that i found common everywhere when it comes to crime stories is that is reported in the right direction, it can create huge impact within the audiences.it can give us an idea of behaviour that the society needs to adopt change in order to be more secure and safer. also, it can also help police solve crimes and provide justice for victims and their families.",1,F,HINDI
"i have never used a phone call recording app so this exercise was quite enlightening. it appears that it's difficult to find an app that offers 'all-access' functionalities for phone interview recording for free.  i had a look at this blogsite: https://blog.tapeacall.com/free-record-iphone-calls/ it lists 5 'free iphone apps' to record phone calls. however, all of them have limitations and come at a cost. tapeacall is recommended as the number one option. but after downloading it, i wasn't able to access it for free. it requests you to subscribe.  i also fell upon rev voice recorder: https://www.rev.com/callrecorder. however, this also charges a fee.  during the week, i'll spend more time to further investigate apps and add attempt to add to the discussions here.",1,M,FIJIAN HINDUSTANI
"part 1 scholars of the internet and digital media have been at the forefront of the study of online life, from the initial ""social networking"" to the eventual transition to ""platforms."" platforms play potentially powerful gatekeeping roles by mediating between the parties in a ""platform society"". the algorithmic system deployed by the platform company examines the increasingly important role of automated decision making in contemporary life through ""critical algorithm studies(gorwa, 2019. the internal behaviour of the platform itself is related to the key public interest, which needs to strengthen the supervision and the participation of stakeholders in the common governance. new patterns of digital governance may need to be developed. these include international human rights law or u.s. civil rights law. this can help make policy decisions and provide a platform for legitimacy. part2 i agree with yinuo. the platform governance approach should focus on exploring how to make the relationships that exist in the platform work for the majority of people. platform companies have a powerful influence, and they dominate the market. therefore, a more fair and equitable form of platform governance should be used to manage these platform companies.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"

"i believe levi &amp; dean are highlighting an issue many aboriginal and torres strait islander people face in identifying. by ""identifying"", i don't mean a having sense of congruence with one's indigenous heratige, but moreso being visible within a space as an aboriginal or torres strait islander person and choosing (or having not choice but) to represent that identity.  the paradox of this lies in that as aboriginal and torres strait islander people, we wish to be seen, to be heard and taken seriously, and so we identify. however, in doing so, we jeapordise our identity, running the risk of having it scrutinised as the subject of a wider, public conversation. this wider discussion usually revolves around debating notions of ""authenticity"", another idea that, through the course of australia's colonial history, has come to completely contradict itself (but that's a story for another forum).  public debate surrounding ""authenticity"" then detracts from the purpose of identifying in the first place, as in inserting themselves into local discourse, colonisers + co.

"my choice is passage master - describe the structure of the reading? what is included in the different sections of the reading? explain why. pick out some important passages and summarise them. 

firstly, this article starts with the background that how western pedagogies affect three cities(singapore, hong kong, shenzhen) which take chinese traditional pedagogy. secondly the author generally defines what is western pedagogies and chinese pedagogy and compare the both of them. and then the method that stratified random samplings was used to investigate these two questions which are 'how is chinese literacy taught in early childhood classrooms in shenzhen, hong kong, and singapore?' and 'how were western pedagogies that were promoted through curriculum reform in three cities actually turned into practice?' and then a mass of data were illustrated to analyse chinese literacy classrooms, which provide powerful evidence how western pedagogies were put into practices. the conclusion figure out that direct transplanting of western pedagogies should not be applied into chinese classrooms since culture, language, parents teachers, resources, the education system and other sociocontextual factors play significant role in shaping chinese literacy pedagogy.

however, western pedagogies cannot be obtained well by chinese confucianism since it has been embedded in their intended thoughts. western pedagogies prefers a child-centered approach, integrated teaching, inquiry-based learning and learning through play, small-class or group learning. while, chinese pedagogy is quite different from western pedagogies which emphasizes conformity, discipline, behavioral control and academic achievement. 
western pedagogies has been introduced to china and asia areas for a long period, nevertheless, no obvious change shows chinese pedagogy has obtained well. while the truth of this is the rooted awareness of the culture.",1,M,"CHINESE, NEC"
"hi leigh,
this may be a bit of a stupid question, but when we're speaking and justifying our ideas with references to literature how do you want us to reference the literature? is it okay to say something like,
""problem based learning as been recognized as an approach that promotes critical thinking through research such as sudi et al., (2020)""
it just sounds a bit funny to say 'et al' out loud, is this okay?

"how will you work towards leading a picture of education that reflects your comments and insights from the first few weeks of this semester, focusing on a big picture of education that meets the purposes you had defined early on?
determine what is enacted on and that which isnt. doing all is impossible so being selective and looking at the level of mandate is important.
revisit the type of leadership that i have in the following areas
administrative leadership
pastoral leadership
teaching and learning leadership
staffing leadership
community leadership

consider ways to go about policy enactment what is my stance and direction on this;
level of consultation
level of transparency
culture influence
strategic implementation for maximizing buy-in

draw on strengths of a leader in the know/do/demonstrate realms
continue to compare and contrast so that others mistakes can be built on from so as to not repeat the situation/complications

how does the knowledge you have developed this semester support you to lead towards a different picture of education than might currently be the norm? how do you lead educators to support students to'live well in a world worth living in'and how do you continue to look after yourself as a leader into the future?
i think being informed is important as there are so many pieces of information that being strategic in the process is key. i think i will look at policy a little differently and seek to understand its origins and the historical context a little more.rushing in to meet requirements will be met with reflection and questions so the best implementation can occur. following full process so that staff have buy-in and say is key and builds the culture of trust and transparency.

"my transition issue is about students on school-to-university transitions. one of the main problem that my reading reports is youth inactivity, which is resulted bycontribution may have come from increasing compulsion in public income support for jobless young people. to be specific, though more and better chances are offered nowadays,inactivity has risen even as unemployment has fallen. i believe cultivating students' sense of hunger is necessary. during the whole learning process, student should feel moderate tensed. compulsory goals are set for them as well as high expectation. meanwhile, teachers should encourage them and inspire them to gain their unique traits to show that they are irreplaceable once they step into the industry.in an era of widespread policy orientation towards supply-oriented policies towards youth joblessness, the limitations of increasing education (and training) as solutions deserve particular attention.

"in janet's story, she discusses how she always had a desire to go to university. she seemed to be managing her schoolwork fine, but as she got closer to vce she began to underestimate the workload, but had support from her school.
it appears to me that her biggest struggle once transitioning to university was the change in work delivery and requirement for self-motivation. she was well supported through schooling but once coming to university had to figure out a brand new set of requirements for herself - it is much more self-guided and lessspoon fed. despite this, she persevered with uni and continued her study, unlike friends she mentioned that dropped out.
i feel like the gap in her transition could have been eased by the school - it may be beneficial for schools to introduce education on the university system so that students are more prepared. specifically, it mentions she was not adequately prepared for online teaching. this issue specifically could have been helped through her schooling, as we live in a technological generation and it is often expected that all youths have their own mobiles/computers (whereas janet did not). schools could also alter some of their coursework to be online so that students can navigate online systems.",1,F,ENGLISH
"for international students transitioning into the workforce, a lack of cultural capital can have important implications for their success. most expected behaviours in this new environment will be implicit and not easily identified or learned. as tran et al. explain, a lack of insight into hidden recruitment rules and employers expectations (49) can leave international students at a disadvantage. similarly, they may find it difficult to fit in and get along with peers, which may be perceived as a personality problem, when in fact it stems from a lack of cultural capital. this disconnect can cause unseen challenges for an otherwise qualified and educated individual.

"my transition issue focuses on the high attrition rates of low ses students in higher education. my readings report two main problems facing this cohort. the first involves the limited social capital low ses students have. they often come from families who have not received tertiary education which makes it hard for them to seek support and advice when navigating future pathways (down et al., 2018). the second issue involves the limited cultural capital low ses students have. their upbringing makes it hard for them to assimilate into the dominant culture which creates challenges when navigating the social side of academic life (jack, 2019).
to enhance their social and cultural capital, i plan to organise a mentoring program where students from underprivileged communities can receive mentorship from current monash students and past alumni to help them prepare for university.

"my transition issue is about the transition of university students to the workforce. specifically, the issue is how work-integrate learning (wil) is important to students employment but wil activities have not been well implemented.
a common problem resulting from this is that students are not adequately prepared or equipped for their wil opportunity, leading to a decreased outcome from the experience (jackson, ferns, rowbottom &amp; mclaren, 2015).
for example, students may have limited social capital about industry workplaces. if students are not well-prepared for their wil, they may not have the opportunity to build valuable rapports (pham, tomlinson &amp; thompson, c, 2019). this is typically through effectively communicating and interacting with prospective employers. graduates have limited opportunities to explore industries and businesses in the work field, as such this can push them further from employment
to enhance their social and cultural capital, i plan to introduce a wil program that will take place over five sessions across the period of a week. key content will be covered to best prepare and support students in their industry experience. this may ensure students have various interactions with several forms of capital prior to entering the labour market.

in my opinion, the authors of the article found that, based on the financial benefits and the creation of multicultural environment, an increasing number of australian schools are adopting many policies to international students, especially the students in asia. the english level of these asian students is limited because they use english as a second language in daily life. this situation has brought the teachers many difficulties during the process of teaching, such as the lack of knowledge, the limited time and so on. for this reason, the authors wrote this article to offer the effective solutions to the teachers.

"my transition issue is about the transition of low ses high school students in to university. one of the main issues students from low ses backgrounds face when attending university is the language demands of university study as many have english as their second language(reading, 2016). reading (2016), claimed that students found reading academic sources and writingassignments very difficult, andcontributed to increased stress levels and poor marks. one of theinitiatives universities developed to combat this issue was to havelibrary staff come in to classrooms and work with thestudents face to face. students found that having someone they can then follow up and ask questions without the fear of being judged helped ease the stress of assignment writing (reading, 2016).

"i have used many mindfulness and mediations tools in the past, many revolving around yoga and meditation. this one in particular is a good starting point for someone new to a guided mediation, and with anything practice is something that helps immensely. any type of exercise that draws your mind away from negative thoughts to allow the focus on the breath and just 'breathing' is helpful. i found myself this morning to be clear headed, and ready to face another day without feeling bogged down with unnecessary thoughts.
i would encourage my clients who were needing a break from negative/unhelpful thoughts, or who were stressed and anxious to give mediation a try. there are so many apps available these days, and its really easy to do it anywhere. i would encourage first timers to maybe do a short guided mediation in session, then provide resources for at home practice.

i've thoroughly enjoyed studying edf5656 'practicing inclusion'. admittedly, i was quite anxious upon commencement of this unit as i felt well and truly out of my depth. however, working with each and every one of you have allowed me to build my knowledge and take a confidence towards approaching inclusive education.
my key learnings are as follows:
i've understood the key concepts of inclusion and exclusion.
i've quickly learned that a large amount of schools are not inclusive within their education model.
gained a strong understanding on how to construct a personalised learning plan and the role of stakeholders in this process.
i am now across mtss and what each of tiers 1, 2 and 3 entail.
i've also developed a sound understanding of the legislation relevant to inclusive education.
the role that evidence-based strategies can play in engaging previously excluded learners.
the importance of a collaborative relationship with ta's and the different models that relate to working with ta's.
how knowledge heavy parents and carers are and the importance of engaging them within their children's education.
as previously discussed, i've got a new found confidence to enter the classroom and ensure that i take an 'inclusive approach'. exciting times ahead. thanks everyone for your engagement and assistance within this unit.",0,M,ENGLISH
"1. what resonates with you from the lecture and readings of this week? 
in thanh pham and denise jacksons reading of this week, it talks about the new work arrangements and patterns will be developed in the 21st-century labour market. and schools are encouraged to help their students to better prepare for future workforce expectations. 
in these two weeks, i have heard my teacher friends told me they were learning and preparing to deliver online lessons because of the covid-19. some of the schools and teachers have experiences in teaching online and they have resources that are ready to use, while some teachers have not done this before so they still have quite a lot to prepare. in no matter what circumstances, i think this is a new work pattern that teachers need to face. and i have read articles about how the importance of online education would be raised in the future, therefore, i believe it is important for me as a pst to obtain more skills to prepare for the future employment. and i think having online learning is also a great chance for students to improve their learning ability in using ict.
reasons causing youths employment issues:
2.1 what are the main reasons?
a. young people prefer to find temporary and unspecialised jobs, which are hard to keep on. 
b. in economy well-developed countries, college graduates were supplied at a higher rate than the labour market demanded and they were forced to find employment in lower-skilled occupations (and i think some graduates might not willing to do that, so unemployment was caused). in low economy countries, 31 per cent of youth had no education qualifications at all.  
c. survey of 3000 firms points out that employers find young people lack workplace skills and many school leavers are not ready for employment. 
2.2 what would happen to youths employment in the future?
statistics find that in 2015, one in three people between 15 and 29 years olds were currently unemployed and not at schools. it means 6 million youth worldwide. and the numbers were only expected to grow. 
thanh pham and denise jacksons article also discuss that the future work environment will be shifted to a knowledge-based economy, includes labour mobility, new work arrangements and patterns. so young people will face more challenges in future employment. 
therefore, i believe it is essential for teachers to embark the real-world trends/issues in the lesson design. for example, choose current news as the case study, encourage students to make use of the ict, prepare activities like role play.",0,F,ENGLISH

"week 2

lingard, martino &amp; rezai-rashti talk about how globalisation has had a 'homogenising effect' on education policy. they also discuss how global policy is rearticulated through national concerns. how do you see global policy (such as pisa) playing out in your own context?

in indonesia, pisa might be similar to our national exam. pisa is measuring 15 and 16 years old students performance in reading, mathematics and science for worldwide context. our national exam measuring every students performance in bahasa, mathematics, science, english for junior high school students meanwhile bahasa, mathematics, english, physics, chemistry and biology (for senior high school students who are taking natural science course) and for those senior high school students who are taking social studies they will take bahasa, mathematics, english, economy, geography and sociology. sometimes in the educational field, people still think to measure students capabilities through standardised test such as pisa or national exam. in the past year, national exam became the criteria to determine graduation. meanwhile starting from 2014, national exam is no longer the main criteria to determine graduation as schools have the full right to determine their students graduation or not.

from the indonesian context, some of the people still think that having standardised test is a good way to measure students performance. but the past results showed that national exam might lead into suicidal issue as the results of taking the exam might not be as expected which is why nowadays even though the score of national exam is important, indonesian people realized that standardised test is not the only way to measure students performance. about pisa, it is true that there are lots of improvements that indonesian students must improve especially in the reading performance as our ranks is not quite good. this showed that global policy might have a little impact on education in indonesia. why a little impact? one of the most important thing to consider is that the materials given and the standard for every country is different, so it will take some time for indonesian students to catch up with other brilliant students from other countries.

in my opinion, the idea of global panopticism is like a suicidal mission. and if people want to implement this idea in the educational field, i will definitely going against it. the thing that all educators need to consider about education in this modern era is not making the educational system being restricted. it is true that discipline plays the biggest role in education but that doesnt mean that educators as long as parents need to monitor every single activities that their students or child are doing. for example, the booming online class. online class is seen as the new alternative to improve traditional method of teaching. there are both benefits and disadvantages of implementing online class. one of the disadvantages of doing online class is less monitoring from the educators. what i meant is that when doing online class, students can choose whether to attend the live streaming class or attend the recording version later. this caused challenges to the educators whether all the students will understand the materials or not. if the educators want to be strict, they will keep monitoring how many students and students name who attend the class every single time the class is held. but in reality, not all educators want to do such a thing. they are thinking that it is their students responsibility whether to attend or not attending the online class as their jobs is only to teach materials through online class. besides that, it took lots of time to monitor every single activities that students are doing. this example showed that there is no possibility to monitor every single activities that your students or child are doing and another disadvantages if implementing panopticism in education is that it will break the trust between educators and students, also parents and students. as not all students are comfortable being monitored for every single thing that they do, they will gradually lose their trust on their teachers or parents if they keep being strict like that.

lingard, martino &amp; rezai-rashti warn that we are forgetting to focus on 'what really counts' in education and society, being steered instead to focus on ensuring the competitiveness of the national economy. what do you think of that?

personally i agreed with lingard et.al as nowadays education is used as tools for countries to attract people to have better future career in order to increase the nations economic growth. meanwhile the essential of education is not only getting good grades and degree, but it is more how education can help us to improve our personal growth, thinking and survival and on how people can apply their knowledge to help other people in the society to have better life.

how would you describe the forms of leadership you have experienced in educational organisations?


my past experience while working with both of my primary and senior high school principals were mostly about servant leadership, which leaders goal is to serve. i observed the way they lead the school with the principle to give the best service to students as well as students parents and also be the best principal that can set a good example and also being a good listener to give useful advice to their school staffs (teachers and administration staffs).",1,F,INDONESIAN
"how did you find this exercise?
the exercise was a great way to help me more grounded and less scatterbrained. i particularly liked the part where the voice told us to mentally say in our minds inhale and exhale as and when. i continue to feel an increase sense after listening to the video.
some of the challenges i felt while going through the video was finding myself easily distracted by some of the vocabulary the narrator used such as observing non judgementally our various thoughts that come by, and being compassionate with our distractions. similar to being told to not think about the elephant in the room, i was thinking about my distractions.
would you encourage your clients to do something like this? why or why not?
yes and no depending on the client and what i believe they would respond better to and what situation we are working together in.
this video primarily uses body scanning, but i feel the language used in this video is catered towards an audience who might already be familiar with mindfulness or meditation. telling someone to be compassionate when they might have a different definition of the term may not be helpful in helping them feel grounded.
in addition, the length of the session can be quite challenging for beginners - for some 5 minutes in your own mind can be a new experience, and can be quite confronting for those who arent used to the sensation.
i personally find seated meditation can be somewhat tricky if youre a beginner meditator, and would suggest a shorter session to start with, and something that asks the person activate certain muscle groups or requires mild gentle movements.
i would try a short exercise together during the session, and if the client saw some benefit from that, would then encourage the client to look at online resources (like apps or youtube videos) and would encourage them to try this at home and check in with the client at the next session and encourage them to build a habit around having a regular mindfulness practice.
there are also some very short 10-20 second mindfulness exercises you can do practically anywhere. if the client is experiencing stress and anxiety symptoms at work or in a public place for example, i would also encourage the client to try that as well, when they are noticing a build up of their stress and anxiety.",1,F,CANTONESE

"i feel that ei is a huge advantage in leadership given that leadership is essentially a social connection between beings. personally, i would have loved to have been more approachable and understanding in my younger years, particularly in high school and sports. fortunately through experiences that i will base my essay on, i have managed to gain some of these emotional connections and skills that have definitely benefitted my life.
i feel that there is no one quintessential emotionally intelligent leader. while many may posses the trait, how they implement such leadership may be entirely different based on the needs of the group. perhaps there are emotionally intelligent leaders who see an advantage in working more behind the scenes to allow others to develop important skills, rather than being viewed as a leader themselves. there are also many people who are leaders without even realising it. i can imagine many people on a football field whose hard work, skill andperseverance may be contagious to other players, without them even having to say a word.
it is certainly better to have emotional intelligence than it is to not have it, but i would not put ei as the 'be all or end all' of leadership skills as i believe that the benefits of ei are circumstantial. there may be some leaders who do just fine by having their other qualities are viewed as essential for that particular circumstance. i think back to being told something about how navy seals had a higher count of a certain chemical than others that reduces their stress in certain situations. in dire circumstances, it may be this individual that others look to for their sheer military competence and survival ability rather than a quality such as ei, which for that particular situation may not be a priority. however, out of the military context, these qualities may not be desired by others.
emotional intelligence certainly allows you to extend your influence but i would suggest that someone who has ei would use it to raise and mentor others from a position of collaboration rather than a top down perspective.
finally, could anyone help me with the bellow quote? what exactly does a negative prediction mean?
joseph and newman (2010, p. 54) concluded that ei ""positively predicted performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicted performance for low emotional labor jobs"".

i particularly resonate with your point ""equal contributions and inputs"" in the strengths section. i feel it is sometimes very easy for different stakeholders to get carried away with their respective inputs. just like inclusive education, everyone is entitled to an input in these meetings and their opinions as just as important as everyone else, regardless of their role. i feel sometimes a teacher may feel more entitled to share than someone else given the time they spend with the student in their learning context. whilst this is not always the case, it can often lead to the conversation and meeting being slightly skewed. parents, teachers and special needs stakeholders all hold equal weight and equal opinions.

"poem: i shall arise (i plan to utilise both written and audiovisual formats)year level: 10activities: for a warm up, i will engage the students in a general discussion about poetry - what they think it's used for, whether they enjoy it, what poetry they have engaged with already etc. this is to get them thinking about poetry as a form using frontloading, whilst enabling the teacher to get an idea of what students' interests are.  moreover, we will also talk about the contextual background of the poem - the civil rights movement. i will each get each student to find a newspaper article which chronicles this issue. the aim of this component is to get them thinking about the purpose and aims of the poem - why was it written? next, i will get them to watch the audiovisual of the poem and read the written text. i will split the class into small groups, giving each of them a stanza to interpret and rewrite in written prose. these will be compiled on a google doc or equivalent so students have a transcription of the poem which is relevant and in language which they can understand. lastly, students will work on a character profile for the writer/narrative voice of the poem. i would utilise the process of scaffolding to get them started on this task. for example - how old do you think they are? do you think they are male or female? what sort of town do they live in? do you think they are rich or poor? students may focus on any of these prompts or use their own ideas. learning/engagement
my learning and engagement aims link strongly tovcela457 -understand that peoples evaluations of texts are influenced by their value systems, the context and the purpose and mode of communication. it is my intention to highlight to students the political, social and historical contexts of poetry, which ultimately informs both the theme and structure of the text. emphasising the purpose of these texts will render the poetry more relevant, not simply words written to sound pretty or to rhyme.",1,F,ENGLISH

"1. the unhelpful and unconstructive teacher response
it would be unhelpful for the teacher to begin yelling for the students to stop, as this might not even stop them in the first place and will only cause lack of control for the teacher as well as damage to their voice.
it would be counterproductive to remove the instruments immediately after giving it to them, as this will only halt learning opportunities and could aggravate the behaviour, as well as punishing students who were behaving to begin with.
becoming visibly angry at the students could also stir them on even further, shifting the balance of power and causing further behavioural issues.
2. the positive constructive teacher response
as mentioned within the workshop slides, it is reasonable to assume that most (if not all) students will play the instrument when given to them. however, before handing out the equipment, it should be important to discuss the rules and guidelines that students will follow when they have an instrument. like general classroom rules, these should be discussed and negotiated with students and placed somewhere that can be referred to in the future, so that everyone is clear on how to properly handle the instruments. examples of these would include proper use of the instrument before they handle it themselves, following indicators of the teacher to stop sound when necessary, to keep noise levels appropriate to the environment, and how to put them away with care after use.
when instructing the class, teachers should have some kind of indicator (such as a rhythmic clap or hand signal) to bring the group back into focus. for a bit of variety, the teacher can act as the class conductor, making students decrescendo to no sound and cutting the sound off at the end. in larger group scenarios, you could divide up the class into groups, and each group will play whatever is required by the teacher at that time, followed by the next group, until all groups have played that excerpt. this could allow for more control over the noise, but could also cause students to become bored if they're inactive for a while.

"i believe my high school teachers taught with the 'form-focussed instruction' approach (ffi) (pachler, evans, redondo &amp; fisher, 2014). as a pupil, i distinctly remember doing drill after drill, writing out conjugations, copying sentences and a multitude of grammatical structures from the whiteboard. while these activities helped me to understand the basics, this method also overwhelms the pupil and often demands memorising to be used, rather than obtaining a complete understanding and personal meaning.
during my early years of university, the educators used a combination of ffi and communicative language teaching (clt) (pachler, et al., 2014). there were often grammar exercises, however, one lecturer would begin informal discussions, usually about what we did on the weekends. from these discussions the educator would progress onto the current contextual topic, for example, describing different environments, hotels, ordering food, describing family members, etc. this allowed us, the pupils, to engage and 'communicate personal meaning' through 'real contexts' regardless of grammatical errors (pachler, et al., 2014). i found this to be a particularly beneficial exercise.
within clt, task-based learning and teaching (tblt) was also a popular approach. for verbal assessment, we were often paired or grouped and asked to create a skit regarding the current topic. these assignments were often very successful as they allowed students the freedom to create a dialogue that had personal and pragmatic meaning. that is, the use of language in context (pachler, et al., 2014). a negative for this approach may be how incredibly time consuming it is to create a lesson as it involves such deep reflection for all aspects (the pre, during, and post-task). however, as a future teacher, i see this slight inconvenience and a non-issue when considering the success of my pupils.

morning routine:on my most recent placement, i witnessed a grade five classroom that had a ""morning routine"". part of this routine was that they had a quiet 10 minutes of reading every morning. this was used to prepare the students mentally, as it got their brains working but also left them feeling calm and ready to take on the day. each student had their own book and they were not limited to what they could read. interestingly though, the teacher monitored what they were reading to ensure it was challenging enough for them.overall, i really love this idea!

"what is different and distinctive about indigenous education  why are we talking about this topic anyway?for non-indigenous education, indigenous education is different and special. indigenous knowledge systems and western knowledge systems operate in different ways. for indigenous students, it is often tricky to question the interpretation of the corpus based on their knowledge of their own culture. however, each coin have two sides, and indigenous education is also beneficial. indigenous knowledge involves a range of interests, such as sustainable development, biodiversity and conservation interests, business and corporate interests, and indigenous interests. anthropological research on indigenous societies and cultures provides evidence for the subject theory of human evolution and development. all knowledge production about indigenous people is still operating in a wider range of social relations that rationalize and strive to continue complex bureaucratic, management and disciplinary actions we have to admit that indigenous knowledge, like our other knowledge production , lies in the field of discourse.
what might be the role and activities of a critical thinking community in relation to indigenous education?critical thinking communities help people form inclusive educational concepts in education and respect differences. needless to say, critical thinking allows us to think about indigenous education in many ways, not only to see its shortcomings, but also its advantages and benefits. indigenous education can promote modern education in some ways, such as protecting the original ecological environment, and history. educators should strive to match indigenous education, teaching and future careers through critical thinking.
what might be the role and activities of a critical thinking community in relation to other issues?
critical thinking is thinking in a rational, reflective, and open-minded manner, so that it can express clearly and accurately, reason logically, reason reasonably, and cultivate the spirit of speculation. a critical thinking community makes education more inclusive and respects differences. in addition, critical education makes society more fair, such as fair employment.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"design:
while classrooms have a mat that is used multiple times everyday during explicit instruction time (year 3s), we do not have the space to set up individual work-desks and group-work table settings. desks are arranged so that 4-6 students are seated at each station, though the configuration can vary according to the teacher. i know a year 3 teacher who prefers her seating to be more traditional, i.e. rows of tables and chairs all facing the front of the classroom.
some classrooms have 5-6 lap-desks to facilitate students who have trouble focusing at their stations and/or require closer proximity to the teacher occasionally.
establish (routines):
most teachers start the morning with the roll, and then talk briefly about what the day will look like. the days timetable is set up on the white-board every morning before the students trickle in for the day.
at the beginning of the year, teachers explicitly demonstrate where classroom materials are kept, like whiteboards, markers, erasers, lunch-tubs (for the canteen), etc.
establish (expectations):
at the beginning of the school-year, teachers lay down the basic classroom expectations very clearly. posters with these expectations are displayed cheerfully in front of the classroom, and the teacher refers to these often as she addresses unwanted behaviour.
students sign a behaviour expectation contract (encompassing all those agreed-upon expectations) with the classroom teacher and their peers. this is also prominently displayed in the classroom.
teach:
teachers use didactic methods to teach expectations.
some teachers use role-play, books or videos to depict a visual for desired behaviour.
reinforce:
teachers address undesired behaviour in a timely, age-apprpriate and respectful manner.
respond:
teacher addresses undesired behaviour by acknowledging he/she has noticed it and asking the student what he/she can do to correct it.
the teacher makes sure that desired behaviour is publicly appreciated.
engage:
most teachers use real-life contexts for their instructions to make tasks more interesting and engaging for students.",1,F,URDU
"anderson makes a statement -  classrooms were built for baby boomers, i found myself nodding my head and laughing silently in one of the booths at work. i cannot agree with him anymore than what i currently do. traditional classrooms have been built and yet to shift from its established roots. as a pre-service teacher on various school visits, i have seen classrooms shift from its orthodox ways, but only at a primary school level. secondary schools are still fairly dull and dry. however, drama is one of those subjects that can instantly go from the dull-dry theory, to taking your shoes off and buzzing around the classroom (in all levels). 
i was quite surprised when anderson used the word extol to describe arts and creativity within schools. in my educational experiences (attending one primary, two high schools; plus recent time in other schools as a pre-service teacher)  extol wouldnt be my choice of words. i see the importance of drama and creativity in school education across all levels. in fact, i am waiting to hear from a tutor if my research topic can be based on how the arts within the school curriculum can heighten students emotional intelligence.
in my short experience as an amateur actor, i began understanding myself and people, through the routine of auditioning and creating a new character. 
as a pre-service drama teacher, i once worked with year 10 students with their examined monologues. i remember feeding my drama/acting philosophy to a girl who kept saying 
im scared ill forget my lines. i told her not to worry about remembering lines - because the audience can see when youre trying to memorise a script know your story line, know where your character is going, and you can make up the lines to take you there. 
moments later, sipping my instant coffee in the staffroom, it dawned on me that her monologue may be assessed on word for word accuracy. this brings another one of andersons points where i, once again, found myself doing the same nod  that we do not and cannot mirror exactly what happens in professional theatre.",1,F,GREEK
"creative connector: by looking at the broader social context of this article, we can picture that there are some local and social contextual constraints such as the examination-oriented education system, parental expectations of academic achievement, the tradition of direct instruction and rote learning, and the overloaded curriculum (cheng, 2006, li &amp; rao 2006). moreover, the socio-contextual factors have further constrained the adaptation of western practices: overcrowded and cramped classrooms, very large class sizes, untrained teachers, unrealistic parental expectations (hu, 2002; li et al., 2008; tang &amp; maxwell, 2007).

"target behaviour: handwashing one of the potential threats stemmed from the speed at which handwashing was occurring. although the task analysis and recording sheet broke down each step of the handwashing procedure clearly, it was still difficult to observe these when they were completed by the participant in quick succession. this may have potentially impacted on the validity and accuracy of these data.  participant reactivity may have also affected the data, particularly the accuracy and reliability. when measuring the duration of handwashing it was noted that the resulting data were variable and had an increasing trend. this may have been due to the participant being aware of the observer, especially the observers stopwatch which made a noise when the start and stop buttons were pressed.

confounding variables may have also contributed to the threats to accuracy and relaibility. it is not know if the participant was researching handwashing procedures betwwen observation sessions. a number of measures were originally taken to reduce the likelihood of the validity, accuracy and reliability of data being compromised. these included such measures as always using the same setting, soap and soap dispenser, the same stopwatch to record all measurements, a clear data sheet with each step broken down and a definition of behaviour outlined on the sheet. in order to increase the validity, accuracy and reliability of data, further measures could be implemented. these may include the installation of a camera over the basin where handwashing is to occur so that a recording could be made and observed at a slower speed so as not to miss any of the steps. at this point an ioa could also be employed since the handwashing procedures are captured on camera. utilising nave observers to record data from the videos would have further strengthened this investigation. the data i obtained could have also been measured in a third way to strengthen the overall value of the study. each of the steps of the handwashing procedure could have been separately analysed and a bar graph of the data generated. if this were done, the data would have revealed that certain steps of handwashing had a low mastery rate (0%), whilst others were already at 100%. these data would have in turn influenced the type of intervention to be planned for in the future.",1,F,ENGLISH
"are any students excluded? segregated? integrated? included? can you see any evidence of the darker parts of history in relation to students with disabilities in your school e.g. unconsious bias or low expectations? history you will need to draw on the reading ""inclusive education as a human right"" to explore these
inclusive education is a process that starts from segregating students with special needs to integrating them and eventually including all students into the mainstream settings (juliet, jenna, linda and catia, 2020). from my previous working experiences in hong kong, the development of inclusive education is still in progress. as early childhood education in hong kong is privately owned and rely on the market forces, there was limited support for promoting inclusion in early childhood education.
it was a whole different story in hong kong early childhood education compared with australia. with the large class size, 1:15 and tight class schedule, teachers usually have a low expectation for those young children with special needs, especially for those with the emotional and behavioural disorder or autism. with the standard curriculum and specific series of textbooks, those special needs students will be excluded from some of the class activities due to their short attention span or sensory issues. some teachers argue that the behaviour of those special needs students would bring some adverse impacts to the concentration of others. there was an extreme case that i experienced before, students who are in the six years old group would have their soccer session once a week. the teacher used a safety reason as an excuse to exclude the autistic child from participating in it and saying that he might not be able to control his behaviour and harm for others. because of this, that kid never has a chance to play soccer in kindergarten with his peers.
although inclusion is not easy to implement in education settings, there were still some cheerful examples in hong kong. some of the private kindergartens will have extra funding to achieve inclusion and hire professionals to support teachers and parents. assessment adjustments were made for those with dyslexia, for example, adding those extra dots or spacing in the drawing and writing worksheets. also, there are regular teacher meetings to follow up the development of the special need students. apart from that, i was surprised that students from the four years old group tried to explain to me when an autistic kid had a burnout with lying down on the floor and yelling. its okay. he needs some times to calm now because he is not feeling good. the child showed me the fantastic job that the teacher has been done. including all students are more than adjustments of pedagogy and assessment, it is also related to real understanding among their peers as well.
as mentioned in the reading, the convention on the right of persons with disabilities (crpd) bound regulation regarding the implementation of inclusion in australia (juilet et al., 2020). it fosters the development of inclusion among all stakeholders in the education settings. it is doubtless that inclusive education is still developing in hong kong. in order to facilitate inclusive education, sufficient teacher education and reformation of the education system is critical in early childhood education.
did anything in the chapter ""legislation, litigation and implications for inclusion"" surprise or concern you? have you observed students with a disability experiencing direct or indirect discrimination? are all students in your context who are covered by anti-discrimination legislation provided with the reasonable adjustments that they are entitled to?
the chapter mentioned consulting the students in making adjustments in their learning plan in the disability standards for education 2005(dse) (poed,2020). it is a new concept to me, but it is so true that they should be the one who understands their needs most but may not be a good option in early childhood education.
education bureau promoted the whole school approach to provide guidelines for schools to implement inclusive education in hong kong. however, students with disabilities are still facing a different variety of discrimination in school settings. for example, students are free to dress up themselves for those parties and special events in kindergarten. one of the autistic students gets very upset if their daily routines are broken. she is not willing to wear other clothes except for the school uniform to the school. because of this, you cannot find her face on the photos of those activities due to the different dress codes. similar case with the no hat no play in reading, the examples of indirect discrimination completely violate the participation of the student. i dont see the point for insisting equality in these cases. i am glad that the parent of that students raise this issue to the school principal, and they realise that some of the rules can be flexible to some extent. 
are there any implications for assessment or individualised planning arrangements for students with disability in your school? 
in the kindergarten that i worked in hong kong, we made a few adjustments in pedagogy and teaching materials like providing the different texture of materials and having a smaller group size for students with special needs in order to engage and encourage them to participate in those class activities. however, it was not compulsory for every class teachers did the same for those students with special needs. apart from that, we do have the individualised educational plan (iep), but there was not much that we can follow up as a teacher due to the large class size, standard curriculum and insufficient knowledge regarding inclusive education. all the arrangments that the school had made as part of the show they presented to the parents. it was really sad to say it in that way, but without the reformation of the education system, the development of the students with special needs is not guaranteed.

in terms of australian values, i think there are some ideas around cultural diversity such as acceptance and celebration of other cultures that i think are important. i would also add a common respect for the australian environment, because it is very unique in a global sense, and is shared by everyone which makes protecting it a common good. we also definitely hold a lot of social values and idiosyncrasies that are picked up on by travellers as unique, which are hard to pin down but do contribute to our national identity. however, as mentioned in the satirical australian values video, we do share a lot of our grander political values like equality and democracy with other countries.",1,M,ENGLISH

"i have been a determinist since i watched this philosophical debate years ago between a deterministic philosopher and a scholar of free will. at first appraisal this ideology might seem unromantic or lacking in poetry, but the practical lens of determinism is in many ways more compassionate, emotive and feeling than its counterpart (free will).
determinism prevents society from making value-based judgements on each other such as ""they are evil, they are criminally insane etc"" and instead takes into account the observable recorded life events of individuals, providing context as to why some people behave anti-socially. this is the underpinning philosophy on programs such as norway's rehabilitative prison system. norway has one of the lowest recidivism rates in the world as their incarceration programs are less about labelling an individual as criminal and locking them away and more about teaching the prisoners new skills for the outside world.

"questioner 
the questioners role in literature circles is to take notes of what questions come to mind when reading the text (daniels, 2002). these questions are then delivered to the literature circle to and the other group members answer them. as discussed in winch et al, (2020) on page 84, in order to become competent with comprehension, one must reflect on the text before, during and after reading it. this allows children to gain insight into the meaning of the text by asking themselves questions like what is the main idea? (winch et al., 2020, pp. 85).

as such, by implementing the questioner role (daniels, 2002) in literature circles, children are able to begin to become thoughtful readers. to teach children how to do this explicitly, you could begin with getting all of the children to read a small passage and then create questions from what they have read. you could then get them to share their questions with the group to encourage discussion. students could write these questions down or have them in their heads.",1,F,ENGLISH
"some of the conclusions really surprised me while others seemed quite confusing.
i did not realize that learning and development were quite different. i was unaware that development is the inherent, biological development of the child (i thought it was heavily influenced by learning in the real world). i found it interesting that development can explain learning, essentially, that learning is the 'function of total development'.
i was intrigued by the plasticine ball thought process and how children learn at different levels. at the first level, they only concentrate on one dimension, either the length or the width. then as the sausage is elongated further, the children may concentrate on a different dimension, the second level. then the child will oscillate their concentration on both dimensions, the third level. finally, the child will understand that the amount of plasticene remains the same due to the inverse relationship between the length and width of the sausage as it is stretched, the fourth level. i found this intriguing as it shows the different stages of learning a child may go through and how learning is sequential.
i was confused by some of the language in the article. i don't think the words such as operations and actions were defined clearly, which made some passages very difficult to read. also, piaget talked in circles in many sections, repeating himself using different sentences.

"critical thinking is a special and thoughtful thinking. however, there are various and defensible definition of critical thinking. some scholars claim that critical thinking is to challenge a theory and idea. on the other hand, others regard it as the ability to consider a wide range of information derived from different sources, to process and analyze these in a logical manner, and lastly arriving at considered conclusion.
in the process of leaning, assessing information in a critical manner is a prerequisite to achieve academic success. and some researchers assert that developing critical thinking is an significant goal of education. as a student, i think critical thinking is particularly important, no matter in the professional practice or in the daily life. there are two reasons to explain its importance. firstly, in the process of critical thinking, we constantly deconstruct or synthesize ideas associated with complex ideas. in this deliberate process, we can learn to view a problem from a variety of different perspectives and angles, in addition, we can develop our own argument. secondly, critical thinking involves not accepting everything as read, we can ask why something is the way it is. as a consequence, we can learn to question everything in our daily life and improve our dialectical ability.

"quote: we are critically looking into this shift of focus from content-based to competence-based because we suspect this could contribute enormously to checking the falling of examination performance ... in fact, teachers were not prepared enough for this shift due to lack of enough funding. - the department of education officials.
the department of education is the highest but not necessarily the most important contributing body to the education policy of any country. it highlighted quality education to take a paradigm shift from being that of content-based to competence-based to counter the falling exam performances. however, the constraint of quality education cited has been the lack of funding resulting in lack of availability of qualified teachers. if the policy makers of the country take into view the ideas of the department in its entirety and call for a competence-based approach to education, it will sure be a step closer to making education sustainability a reality. also, if the existing teachers are trained in subjects like curriculum analogy and pedagogy selection, that will contribute positively towards the goal. the government may opt to raise the pay and introduce perks for teachers to attract greater talent to this extremely important role of shaping a countrys future. 
having said that, i would like to argue that a mere shift of the education approach will not be enough, the shift should be rather procedure-oriented more than just result-oriented. if improvement of exam performance is the only motivation, though a great suggestion of the shift, it will fall very short of its aim. sustainability is not a one or two day thing, it will require time and acceptance of several changes constantly, it is more of an evolution. therefore, only training the teachers and availing funds will not help the situation. this will need an elaborate plan and a step-by-step implementation schedule to be monitored strictly and changed constantly if anything goes off-track.",1,F,BENGALI

"why is adult education important to me?
adult education matters to be because it fosters a greater understanding and of the world, ourselves, and each other. i believe this knowledge can birth creativity, openness towards the other, and for many, the opportunity to participate more fully in shaping society alongside others. this viewpoint most closely fits those of a feminist-emancipatory tradition in its desire for social transformation as educations goal. however, it also has humanist links which are more fully captured in my second reason.
this reason is best described as a belief that people are always meant to be learners. in the christian tradition, jesus called his followers' disciples. the word disciple comes from the latin discere or discipulus meaning - learner. people who follow jesus are considered to be students. learners, seeking to grow in their understanding of the mysteries of god and the world the he has made, as well as learners who seek to follow the example of their teacher, jesus, in their everyday lives. in a sense, this learning never ends. i understand that those of other faiths or none may find fault with this reasoning. however, in my context as an adult educator in a christian non-profit, the alignment of my beliefs in education and those of my faith are foundational in my vision of life-long learning.
location of 2 writers in one of the maps of adult education traditions:
the theories of schn fall neatly within the humanist tradition. schn sees the goal of reflective learning as gaining greater expertise with ones chosen profession, often seen as having good intuitive knowledge. this personal fulfilment doesnt have any societal function, and the professional is seen primarily as a self-taught through the method of reflection-in-practice. while professionals may need others to point out blind spots, schn does not see this as the role of a teacher, but a colleague or peer.
mezirows theories however better align with the critical-humanist tradition, where the goal of education is greater autonomy and inner change. this is born out in his research into women participating in college reentry programs in the early 1970 and the transformational learning theory that stems from it. the role of the teacher is one of facilitator in mezirow's and the critical-humanist tradition. this is because education places power in the hands of the student who creates their new identity through learning.

trust in a professional-client relationship is indeed important! without trust, it is difficult to plan, intervene and evaluate an effective treatment at the best interest of the client. putting myself in their shoes, i believe that they want the best for their child. some parents are desperate when they think that the progress is slow, even with effective and excellent intervention, leading them to consider alternative treatments which are lack of empirical verification.

"as i worked my way through this weeks readings, several sections resonated with me in my leadership role and my thinking about the current educational system. i agree it would be ideal if we were using education as a fore for strengthening the imagination (p.715 giroux) and it is frustrating that rarely do educators ask questions about how schools can prepare students to be informed citizens (p.716 giroux). i believe doing this more consistently and more broadly in a variety of educational settings wouldimprove the educational experience for all. while we continue to work within a results driven system, the opportunity to provide an education that recognises the individual circumstances, talents, skills, backgrounds and interests of all is diminished.
we need to question themeasurement that is used as a means for determining the success or reputation of individuals and educational institutions. biesta asks if weshould be valuing what we measure or measuring what we value? (p.33) and states the danger here is that we end up valuing what is measured (p.43). my inclusion of what subjects, skills and knowledge arenotspecifically targeted as part of naplan highlights a frustration of mine. to contrast this, i have included the ways some higher educational institutions, both in australia and overseas, are now looking at an individuals character, co-curricular involvement and personal profile as part of the application process for courses and scholarships.
i enjoyed the readings this week as a stimulus for my thinking. creating the mind map was also a refreshing break from the challenges of dealing with the current covid-19 crisis.i have tried to include what an ideal education could/should look like. i have also added some of the restrictions that we face when trying to embed educational practices, policies and philosophies that will allow all students to receive a high quality educational experience.",1,M,ENGLISH

thank you for your excellent presentation talking about single-sex schools and co-educational schools.i think that it is an interesting topic to learn about. it is quite helpful that you gave a defining clarification prior to details of your argument, as i felt uncertain when i first saw 'co-education'. however, this explanation sounds more like an 'introduction' rather than an 'outline', as i think that an outline here gives a summary for what you will present in the coming sections. also, i would suggest you to state the argument literally (in a sentence), because this statement is a source to examine if your key points repond to your arguement closely. lastly, i have a different perspective on your topic regarding to word choice:in my opinion, when we are talking about 'difference', we compare objects' features or characteristics.based on this, when i first saw your topic, i thought that the key points would focus on differentiated characteristics of both schools, such as different policies, different course structures and different workforce. however, the key points you raise here, such as academic achievement and school satisfaction, as i personally perceive, tend to focus on 'different effects' of both schools rather than 'the difference' of both schools. in particular, since most of evidence you found show positives on single-sex school, maybe you could consider taking into account the 'advantages' of single-sex school.",1,M,MANDARIN

"i do not believe that english belongs to anyone, nor does any other language. languages are global and should be open to all. level of proficiency will depend on the individual and the time they invest in learning the language.
my experience has been that many proficient language learners start in one area and develop their skills as they immerse themselves within a country. academic english learning allows for vocabulary which pertains to that specific task. many students studying abroad still struggle to communicate effectively with local students in terms of general conversation, yet they perform well in the classroom.
sometimes travel to different english countries proves difficult as the nuances and slang of that country are not understood. my experience of taking my friend to south africa the point in question. seeing a host of new animals with difficult names some never heard before can prove to be very difficult over extending periods of time. like an information overlaod.
i believe empathy is required for students who converse in english and dont get it all correct. i find it very hard to correct jack because of our friendship, but as time has gone on if i dont nudge him gently he will never truely learn all the correct ways of saying words or how to put together  better english sentences in conversation. academically speaking there needs to be a benchmark of obtaining prominent level to move forward in gaining degrees and year 12 certification. much like trying to learn mandarin or any other language. academic institutions will have a bench mark of achievement.
my experience being foreign in australia means i use the language differently at times. colloquial sayings, wording and how things are meant sometimes can be offensive to others. experience has also taught me that that it is not just what we say but also tone and body language. different people from different countries operate differently, so there are times when you are misunderstood.
being an intercultural speaker is a work in process, every day teachers us how much we dont understand, and how much we can get wrong. although intention is good we can easily be misunderstood or misunderstand others. empathy and patience is a good starting point, also stating the obvious sometimes helps.
having lived and worked in china makes my view of foreign students profoundly different. the experience of seeing first hand how difficult it is to learn in a foreign language changes how you see these students in a different country like australia. the difficulty of not just making educational progress but also the social and emotional aspect of their world makes me seek avenues to help.",1,F,ENGLISH

"i started learning english in china when i was in primary school. although different teachers guide my english learning at various stages, but they have a similar teaching mode. looking back at my language learning experience and trying to compare it with second-language acquisition, i find that the learning pattern is ppp, that is, presentation, practice, and output.

when chinese language teachers impart new information or knowledge, they always explain and introduce it to us first, using some examples to help us understand it. obviously, this model is based on the chinese language teaching method, through repeated practice to academic learning out of me. therefore, homework plays an important role in my language learning experience, because the teacher asked us to do some exercises to memorize these teaching contents. the teacher then encourages us to use this knowledge, such as grammar and vocabulary, to have impromptu conversations with other students in a simulated situation.

however, this theory can be a double-edged sword. there is no denying that ppp framework enables students to repeat and practice new language forms in a short time. it helps students digest and validate their new knowledge. on the other hand, the problem is that knowing grammar and words does not mean that students have fully learned a new language. it can not guarantee that students can express the language comprehensively and holistically. i realized this when i was learning english on my own. when i interact with my classmates in class on a particular topic, it's not difficult. however, i sometimes get confused when i go beyond this and have to communicate with native english speakers using several different language structures that i have learned at the same time. this can be explained by what we discussed last week. language is based on cultural background, so a simple purchasing power parity model is not enough for students to understand the meaning of the new language and the rules of communication that can not be described by fixed rules.",1,F,"ANMATYERR, NEC"

"in this article, the authors claim that ethnical consumption has been an important factor for schools of being related to equity in a school-choice regime. they argue this question with supporting several main points. this article is clearly structured that all main points are orderly divided into different paragraphs with sub-headings. however, some body paragraphs in this article are not much coherent and well-connected. it would be better if authors could use a connecting sentence between the preceding and the following contents. but it is beneficial that authors use counter-arguments and refutations to strengthen their arguments. for example, authors cite a viewpoint from kenway and bullen (2011) that parents and students could be regarded as both consumers of school and producers exchange value, to support that students use schools for acquiring knowledge and schools sell themselves based on the ability of the students (p.205). and it is advantageous that this article uses many actual examples and statistics to explain concepts and phenomena in order to make audience understandable and build relationship between audience and this paper. for instance, authors use scotch college and victorian state schools in the part of marketing equity in australian schooling to make a comparison between private schools and state schools in australia on marketing equity which makes audience recognise there is an inequity existing in educational system (p.207). at the same time, authors use a mass of data to show that there is a disparity between greywater school and willow college on resources (p.210). however, it would be better if this article could have implications or recommendations to guide and extend audiences own thinking of this issue. overall, this article argues authors opinions appropriately with clear structure in academic language.

i would ask myself why i feel that no one understands me. i could say that no one fully understands themselves, much less someone else; hence managing my expectations. am i also being vulnerable and letting others in? why is it important that someone understands me? so the alternative thought is that maybe i do not need someone to understand me; if i wish, i can either learn to open up even more to friends and family or hire a counsellor whose job is to listen without judgment.
as for my dissatisfaction with my life trajectory, i could ask myself where i would like for my life to go and what i could do to effect change so that my life can be where i envisage it. if it is beyond my power to steer my life where i want it to be, i can learn to accept that my current life is simply where it is not for the lack of effort on my part; hence again managing my expectations.

"1. after looking at the two readings for this week, how would you describe the ability to think critically? to be able to think critically, i am of the opinion that assessing and evaluating the received information is significantly crucial. in accordance with blooms theory, deep understanding and questioning should be done in order to synthesize and evaluate the context. in my point of view, disbelieving whatever we see or hear without evidence or evaluation, or believing the information immediately are therefore the fundamental distinction of critical thinking and why it is needed. after listening to soccer boys, it is considered that critical thinking fosters us to be skeptical and avoid stereotypes.
2. what do you think the relationship is between critical thinking and speaking/writing? it is highlighted by ku,2014 that thinking critically advances our ways of thinking and our thoughts. since speaking and writing are productive skills, i think that the more ideas we have, the better we can produce in terms of speaking and writing.
3. are there any differences between logical reasoning and critical thinking? if so, what are they? in my opinion, there is a fundamental correlation between logical reasoning and critical thinking. both of them have primary activities, such as thinking, reasoning, and deciding or drawing conclusion. the significant difference is the way we think, as an example in kus article, formal logic depends on correct and certain information which is not similar to how we would think in everyday reasoning.",1,F,"BURMESE AND RELATED LANGUAGES, NEC"

"i think an effective way to teach children about the different roles in literature circles is to explicitly model these roles during shared reading sessions. for example, at the beginning of a shared reading session, the teacher might tell the class that he/she will be taking on the role of questioner during the session. the teacher would explain that the role of questioner is to be conscious about what you are thinking while you read and to note questions down for further discussion during literature circle time. depending on the year level, the teacher may provide further explanation as to the purpose of the questioner role, the types of questions that would be expected, and the way that this role can be used to assist with comprehension and understanding of a text. 
during the shared reading session, the teacher would pause from time to time and model the role of questioner by actively thinking out loud and taking notes on the board of any meaningful questions that enter their thoughts during reading. when doing this, the teacher may even explicitly say i think that would be a good question for literature circles, i am going to write it down for later. to engage students and help them to identify the types of questions expected during literature circles, the teacher may even ask the class do you think that would be a good question to bring to literature circles? why or why not?.
at the end of the shared reading session, the teacher would reflect on the role of questioner with the students. it would then be appropriate to ask students to practice this role in their own reading and to share the questions they write down with the teacher or their peers.

"being a christian, i personally believe that humans are created by god with the ability to act freely. faith is a personal choice to begin with, one that is independent of physical influences, but mental deliberations and experiences of a relationship with a personal god. however, i understand that others would question the empiricism of faith, but reading the article by sappington (1990), i agree with the theorists who argued for free will being compatible with the higher-level purposes of science such as prediction and control as facilitated by concepts like conscious choice and human purpose. (i wouldnt be attempting to elaborate further in this post as i am still trying to get a fuller picture of what has been discussed in the article.)
as a result, i think that free will does have a helpful stance to the scientific study of human behaviour rather than hinder it. in the case of what we are studying, to begin with, one of the philosophical assumptions of radical behaviourism is determinism. the world is lawful and orderly, and behaviour is predictable based on the learners history, that is usually consequence-based, which alters future behaviour. i agree this is useful as an important starting point for behaviour analysts to continue their work of helping learners to learn functional skills and/or unlearn non-functional behaviour, and in so doing improve their quality of life. for instance, the abc chart is a critical source of data during functional analysis of a learners behaviour. however, it is in my opinion that determinism and free will are compatible and the notion of free will does serve a useful purpose in the work of behaviour analysts, especially when guiding the process of reviewing and modifying intervention strategies laid out in behaviour support plans. assuming the notion that people can act freely when not constrained or coerced allows behaviour analysts to be flexible and look at other possible functions of behaviour, and not fixate on what was/were previously identified, and in so doing, show respect to the learners whom we work with and their freedom of choice to behave of their own volition. examples being when a child is suddenly cheeky, and maybe uncooperative, but in a non-malicious manner, having never shown such behaviour prior, or when an adult resists temptation or a preferred item, again having never done so prior, or maybe even doing so in the face of social pressure to accept or give in to the temptation or preferred item/activity. it is my view that defining free will as behaviour that just so happens is simplistic and dismissive. such apparent anomalies ought not to throw the data collector off his feet but should serve a socially significant purpose that tells the behaviour analyst more information about the learner, and further guide the constant process of reviewing support plans for the learners benefit.

poses questions and turns comprehension into a discussion.
scaffolds the children to look at the picture for visual clues to make sense of the text and where the text could be going. moving the comprehension talk along the continuum through collaboration. asking students to think aloud.
discusses vocab. before the turning of the page. vocabulary is a key component to understanding meaning. children may decode well but not actually know the meaning to the words they have read. teacher encourages language to extend childrens thinking using their experiences at home (looking, glancing etc.).
children really need to be able to make predictions to monitor for meaning and they are being asked to infer using vocab., what clues are in the text and what do you know about those clues in the real word in regards to what action (verb) will come next.
she models reading the book and prompts children to engage in the text. children copy ''i see a''
cathy:
models reading  pauses, pace, tone, reading from left to right.
reads to students and stops to monitor for meaning by looking at the pictures and recapping on the words read (evidence in the text  i.e. max says no, pointing to the smell). children had to infer the smell came from the kitchen.
reread certain passages after stopping and asking the children to do actions with the passage.

"being a chinese teacher, my own personal aims in teaching chinese are developing students curiosity in learning different language and deepen their understanding of the different culture. according to the pachler, evans, redondo &amp; fisher(2014), the teacher should enable pupils to express their ideas and thoughts in another language and to understand and respond to its speakers, both in speech and in writing. thats also one of my teaching aim which i hope my learner will not only learning the knowledge about the different language, but also they can be engaged and be provided an opportunities to communicate in the original language for practical purposes and can learn a new ways of thinking to reduce stereotypes.
so in order to envisage this aim, it is important about the engagement and communication in my classroom. the biggest problem is students inability to communicate effectively in the country of the language. so for my classroom, i can engage student with games, activity or using multi media to enhance the language learning experience. get learner for the real world by using ict, photos or radio that theyll at least try get hint of how the langue flows, how gestures are used and how quickly native speakers converse. also, i will let them to use the language as much as possible. for example, when they go to bathroom or have simple request, they should use chinese to ask like calling out teacher in chinese. sometimes i can change the sentences structure to let them talk differently and think about there is a different way to ask for a request in chinese culture. these can express their communication skill and also develop an intercultural capability and sensitivity. whereas based on my past placement experiences, a lot of learner will not engage in the language class because they think that they are not the native speaker about this language or they have some negative stereotypes. so it is important that i will teach culture alongside the language. not only teach the traditional history but the modern thing. use news, picture, food, festival top demonstrate the important issue of the day in china. so student can have connection between the target languages country and the students home country. it will also enhance their respect, empathy, commitment, enthusiasm and personal responsibility in their long life language learning experience (scarino &amp; liddicoat, 2009).",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"

explanation


discussion of the background/problem statement, investigation question and significance of the investigation


in the introduction, the authors discuss the background showing the problem in the global context (america, australia, africa, europe and asia). they also define core concepts (sexuality education, inclusive sexuality education, heteronormativity, homosexuality non-acceptance) in the introduction and main body parts in order to avoid further ambiguity. furthermore, the authors present their problem statement, talking about the controversy of the issue, clearly outlining the arguments of parents, religious groups and political parties preventing the development of inclusive sexuality education. at the end of the introductory part, the authors state the purpose and the main argument of their review and outline the contents of their article.


position on the issue and a coherent line of reasoning in the argument


the position of the authors is clearly seen in the introduction and throughout the whole article. by answering the arguments of those who are not in favour of inclusive sexuality education, the authors position themselves as its advocates. the authors position can also be seen through the language they used (...it was truly disturbing to see, unfortunately,...)
there is coherence both between paragraphs and between sentences and ideas within these paragraphs. each paragraph starts with the existing argument, followed by a coherent and logical refutation of the argument and conclusion of the ideas presented within this paragraph.


the use of evidence from academic and other sources


the authors used reliable evidence from various fields ( biology, sociology and psychology) and from contemporary academic resources which were peer-reviewed and no more than twenty years old. also, they highlight that their choice of literature was based on extensive research and single case reports and literature review were omitted, which made the evidence more representative, accurate and reliable and thus, strengthened the main argument.


critical analysis of the literature and evidence


the authors provide a good critical analysis of the literature and evidence, not only discussing and summarising it but also taking into account its limitations and the need for further research.


identification of implications for education research, policy and practice


the authors clearly identified the implications of their finding in the conclusions of each argument, the implications included policy (including sexuality education in the curriculum, creating a safe school climate through sexuality education), practice (implementing sexual education program, not excluding homosexual teachers, help sexual minorities inside and outside educational systems) and research (effect of queer teachers on the formation and gender identity of students, the wellbeing of lgbt teachers, creating positive climate) of sexual orientation


presentation of work (title page, abstract, introduction/conclusion, apa6 referencing, page numbering, spelling/grammar/sentence structure/punctuation, word limit) 


the article is very-well presented and includes all the necessary parts (title page, abstract, introduction, conclusion, page numbering). there are no spelling or grammar mistakes and the sentences are clear and well-structured. however, the referencing is presented in apa 7 style whereas apa 6 is required and word limit is not presented in the title page.

2. explain the main sides/arguments of this debate.
some parents believe it is necessary for a student to finish homework in time because it helps to acquire knowledge. some students are good at studying and they can finish their homework with a short time, but others may not good at every subjects, so they spend more time on it, even lose their sleep time.
however, some parents argue that, sleep well is more important than finish homework at time. they think for teenagers, if they have enough sleep time, they can be energetic and pay more concentrate on class, so they may not have more problems with their homework  the next day. besides, students can ask teachers for help at school, rather than waste too time in order to finish their homework at night.",1,F,"CHINESE, NEC"
"atypical presents a story of sam who has autism spectrum disorder and his strive to find a girlfriend and gain more independence as a young adult.

however, there are some areas of concern regarding julias behaviour as a therapist throughout the series. two of these areas of concern include julias distortion of therapist boundaries and overt self-disclosure which in turn harms her client.julia distorts her boundaries as a therapist by requesting to share a coffee outing sams father and obliges to spontaneous therapy sessions with sams mother after she arrives on the doorstep of julias home. additionally, after sam expresses his desire for julia to be his girlfriend julia becomes outraged and yells/berates sam, in turn causing him to have a meltdown. julias actions toward her client provide evidence that she is not effectively adhering to ethical obligations as a therapist.",1,F,ENGLISH

"my transition issue delves into the concern that surrounds the lack of retention of students with low ses backgrounds when transitioning to university.
cultural capital is a notion intrinsically linked to the experiences students from low ses backgrounds face in higher education. cultural capital can be described as the proficiency in and familiarity with dominant culture codes and practices (aschaffenburg &amp; mass, 1997). students from high socio-economic backgrounds assess with familiarity particular types of knowledge, ways of speaking, styles, meanings, dispositions and worldviews (devlin, 2013) that are entrenched within the higher education system. students from disadvantaged and low ses backgrounds have described feelings of inadequacy and low self-efficacy when it came to transitioning to university (habel et al., 2016). there is much research that expressed the problem lying in the student not the organisation and a deficit conception that the students are the problem. when following this contention, it outlines that any failure to succeed at university is by the fault of the student who is assumed to be in deficit (devlin &amp; mckay, 2011). this is reflective that while cultural capital is a barrier low ses background students face in attempting to enter the sphere of higher education it can not be the only factor in converse with this issue.

"annies facilitation of a young adults hiv-discussion group in zambia, grates against a frierian approach to adult learning. while the goals of the program are frierian in nature by seeking to encourage discussion and ownership of the hiv-aids pandemic, on the lives and community of the participants, it fails at serval points.
primarily the failure is to do with the teacher/participant relationship. while friere acknowledges that a teacher and students will have different cultures, he asserts that the teacher bears the responsibility for bridging the divide and entering into the students culture, internationally so that a horizontal relationship can take place. annie is from the uk, the nation who were in colonial power zambia until the mid 20th century. she speaks english, and only basic nyanga, meaning she is literally unable to connect with participants in their heart language, instead she deputises a local colleague to translate, and by doing so, reiterates a colonial message to the group. the message is two-fold; firstly that her situation in life (a british, english speaker) gives her greater authority to teach than her colleague and secondly that her peers local knowledge is unimportant in this matter. the message of authority is further communicated by holding the discussion in a traditional classroom, likely set up by british colonisers, and by standing at the front of the class, in effect lowering the status of the young adults to children.
the other deviation from a frierian approach is annies handling of the discussion itself. rather than simply proposing the problem at friere suggests, annie sets the discussion topics in such a way that she is seeking to problem solve for the participants. by focusing on answers that she wants to hear while rejecting others, she effectively engages in banking knowledge for the group, rather than helping them to gain a critical view of their reality. this is further emphasised by handing out leaflets with what annie considers to be the right answers or right responses to the situation. the fact that the leaflets are from the uk, speaks to the previous point above.
when participants, eventually break out of annies carefully scripted approach, and begin to engage in dialogue, sharing from their experience and identifying gender power issues, she shuts down the discussion, denying participants the opportunity to engage in praxis and see consciousness arise. in effect, this effectively hinders participants from taking ownership of the situation and working to make their lives better. this ironically is the goal of the training in the first place.

sophie: good example of zpd and scaffolding. guides the children to increase their vocabulary through a picturebookcathy: helped engage the children through gestures with the picture bookleah: starts the structured sentence but doesn't finishes it the entire sentence, allowing the children to engage in completing the sentence from the picture book by yelling out.
vocabulary is a key concept to develop for primary school students (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). according to bridie (2001), 'students start school at age 5, they have acquired a large amount of knowledge about language'. primary school children develop knowledge in language from home talk, which provides familiarity, social relationships and creates intention (bridie, 2001). 
the three videos represented an easy level of challenge towards the young children, which is most appropriate for building vocabulary (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). all of the teachers use direct explanation (biemiller and biemiller, 2006), as they read the story out loud and engage the children to interact. this also relates to the social constructivism concept by vygotsky, by utilising social interaction to drive learning, knowledge and talk (bridie, 2001).
bridie (2001) suggests that teachers need to have patience and address different capabilities. all three teachers show interaction in small groups, of three or more children, reading out loud a picturebook. leah starts reading a sentence and then waits for the children to yell out the last word of green eggs and ham, by dr. suess. leah would sometimes lose her patience slightly, by finishing the sentence before each child has yelled out the response. bridie (2001) also explains that encouraging feedback will engage their actions and attentiveness. leah didn't respond with any feedback throughout the video, she instead continued to read the book in what seemed rushed.
in the video with cathy, she used gestures throughout the reading of the picturebook, which encouraged the children to have claws and wave. this is a good example of incorporating interaction and creating new knowledge (bridie, 2001).
sophie demonstrates the use of scaffolding well. according to winch, johnston, march, ljungdahl and holliday (2020), scaffolding refers to 'support given to students through explicit teaching of skills and knowledge, to move students to a higher level of understanding'. she gives the students opportunities to speak and extend their language. she also shows a lot of support and positive feedback, which makes the students feel practical and useful (bridie, 2001).

select and explore a strategy from the tier 2 strategies outlined at https://www.pbisworld.com/tier-2/, or

discussion prompt:once you have selected your strategy, i would like to you respond to the second moodle forum, describing a student you have taught/observed for whom your selected strategy would be a useful alternative to existing procedures in your school or centre. explain the challenging behaviour exhibited by this student and what data is collected by the school/centre on these types of behaviours. describe the current system for responding to this behaviour. explain why you selected the strategy that you chose for this student and how it would provide a better alternative.
there are a number of students within my primary school context who are in need of extra support due to difficulties with behaviour and who would benefit from small group, targeted social skills instruction that promotes pro-social behaviours.the schools systematic collection of accurate data from both classrooms and the school yard, continually demonstrates that these students have difficulty understanding non-verbal social cues, and interpreting body language and facial expressions during social interactions, often resulting in verbal altercations and sometimes escalating to physical aggression.
this year, we are fortunate enough to have two experienced teachers released for two days per week to customise and facilitate targeted, small social skills groups.using the school-wide behaviour data, approximately 20 students were identified as having an increasing number of incidents recorded.these students were discussed during a meeting with school leadership and the social skills group teachers, and grouped according to the specific behaviour to be reduced or eliminated.these groupings were then distributed to each grade level teaching team so that teachers could collaborate and discuss their observations of these students, and to report any antecedents or triggers to their behaviours.
each group contains 2-4 students, who meet for 30-minute sessions twice per week to participate in lessons where they receive explicit instruction, modelling of replacement behaviours, and then acknowledgement and reinforcement when they display the replacement skills.the students often role-play a non-example of the expected behaviour first and then the appropriate example after it.these are usually recorded via ipad (provided students are willing) and they then watch the clips and are provided feedback by both the teacher and the other group members to alleviate any misrules they may have had.with the group members permission, these videos are then also used during whole-school social skills lessons as exemplars of appropriate, replacement behaviours.
after a relatively short period of 6 weeks (due to extended school holidays and the current covid-19 restrictions), these students had already begun demonstrating a slight decrease in the number of incidents reported, growth in the number of aspire tickets received and increased opportunity to spend at the aspire market.this provides us with cautious optimism, that with continued participation in the tier 2 intervention, an increase in engagement of on task behaviour and a decrease in disruptive behaviours will be reported.",1,F,ENGLISH

my name is kexin shi, and you can call me emma. after reading materials, i have gained a deeper understanding of teaching and learning, and i would like to share my views on the two questions. 
in my opinion, learning is an ongoing process in which learners acquire knowledge or skills and continuously improve their cognition of a certain field. and become a critical thinker and creative learner by solving problems and constantly reflecting on what they have learned.
teaching is considered a cycle of activities. it is not only to impart information or transfer knowledge, but also to play the role of teacher's guidance: to cultivate good learning behaviors of learners; guide learners to become active learners; in the process of teaching, teachers are expected to reflect and evaluate frequently, adjust pedagogy to meet needs or preferences of learners, and help them to achieve better learning outcomes.
from my perspective, teaching and learning complement each other, from which both teachers and learners can benefit. the purpose of teaching is to make students learn better, and in the process of teaching and learning, students give feedback to make teachers aware of problems, thus promoting better teaching and learning outcomes.

"rti model contains three tiers, most of the time we look at the three tiers individually, but these tiers are closely linked to each other. if tier 1 instructions are not constructed well, tier 2 will not be effective, and so as tier 3. therefore, when implementing any tiers in the classroom, collaboration within educators are needed. educators share the same pedagogy and instruction will enable interventions to function effectively in the classroom.
for ece, the majority of educators focus on play-based learning and the use of intentional teaching is low. i think play-based learning should be used in the classroom for children to explore and develop learning dispositions, but intentional teaching is equally important. through intentional teaching, educators deliver explicit instructions and concepts. additionally, before letting children explore hands-on activities, educators may want to demonstrate the task for children before they start practising. moreover, intentional teaching allows educators to review concepts with children.
using precise vocabulary is essential. when educators use vocabularies like more, less, first and second in daily routine with children, it allows children to get familiar with these words and concepts, and children are able to practice using precise vocabularies.
tier 2 interventions deliver in small groups, and each small-group intervention is encouraged to target fewer than two skills at a time (burns et al., 2012). tier 2 interventions serve children who have difficulties in learning the concept or not responding to tier 1 instructions. however, i think including children without learning difficulties in some small group interventions may help all children to learn better. burn et at. (2012) mentioned vygotsky zone of proximal development, if including children who do not require extra support in a small group intervention, through interaction with children with disabilities, children can learn from their peers and it is an effective learning.",1,F,CANTONESE

"my relationship with science would be in a few words: its somehow complicated
ive always found hands on experiments interesting, but it has always been really hard for me to explain scientific concepts, using the right jargon within the context. there was this french show i loved to watch growing up (cest pas sorcier)its not rocket science, which talked about various scientific events from our daily life. the presenter would use start the show with a question to raise awareness on a particular topic and throughout the show he would interview people (quite often experts) and make an experiments to answer the scientific question. i was always fascinated of how he could bring so much clarity to complex scientific phenomenon through visual re-enactment and clearly explaining what was actually happening. as much as i loved that show, in class i always struggled to keep up with science and always found myself struggling to memorise scientific terms for exams. i found the whole process wasextremely difficult and tedious. i was with no surprise that i dropped science for art and languages studies later on in high school.",1,F,FRENCH

"this week i decided to reflect on a specific school policy implementation i have experienced. it centred around improving teaching and learning in the classroom.
staff were asked to work in small groups and visit each others classes to observe the teaching and learning environment and provide detailed feedback. they were encouraged to team up with teachers outside of their subject areas. often the groups were across multiple years levels giving teachers the chance to see the classroom practice in year levels very different from their own experiences.
this was a new initiative and the response from staff was extremely varied. some embraced it right from the start while others were more reluctant to be involved. the negative responses centred around impact it would have in the classroom and concerns with how the information from the visiting teachers was going to be used. some felt it was an accountability measure while others thought it was a form of performance review and there would be follow up (and potential consequences) for those seen as not performing at the expected standard. having other teachers in a class as observers was quite confronting to some staff. for many it had not happened since they were doing their teaching rounds! emotions ranged from being nervous, excited, reluctant, enthusiastic and worried.
it was important for the leadership to acknowledge the concerns of teachers, and how they were feeling, rather than simply dismiss them and impose the new expectations. instead of demanding that the teachers conduct the classroom walks without further discussion, we saw it as vital that the leadership articulated the reasons for the program and recognised the differentaffectsthe initiative was having on teachers. we prioritised informing all staff of the reasons why these classroom walks were being implemented (its a wonderful form of professional development and it improves us all as teachers). the issue of feedback also needed to be addressed because how feedback from the observations would be given and how the information gathered would be used was an area of concern for some. 
key areas of concern were addressed with staff and clear explanations of the process and benefits were communicated. some of these included: visits would only be for about 10 minutes and any observations would be non-judgemental. it was not a performance review and feedback would be given as a group working together as a group. the timing of the visits was organised within the group so there were no unscheduled observations. teachers were encouraged to speak to the students of in classes about the upcoming visits. this normalised the process and students became used to other teachers visiting
recognising that teachers wereaffectedin different ways, and the leadership addressing these concerns, was central to these classroom walks being embedded into the learning culture of the school. those supportive of the idea from the start became leaders within the groups and this developed their leadership skills. staff have enjoyed observing classes, subjects and year levels they do not teach. trust has developed amongst teachers and the feedback is constructive and therefore valued.",1,M,ENGLISH

"just like any infrastructure project, there are costs and benefits of the georgia freight-only highway proposal, and these need to be stacked against each other using an economic appraisal to estimate the cost-benefit ratio for the project. this will establish whether society is better off with or without the project.
benefits of the project include:
travel time savings  moving trucks to their own highway will reduce congestion for private motorists and trucks, and therefore reduce the amount of time required on the road. given travel time savings are valued by both groups, this reduces the travel costs of undertaking trips.
improved travel time reliability  reduced congestion implies a lower chance of being delayed when traveling. motorists and truck drivers can therefore reduce any buffer time added to their trip.
reduced vehicle operating costs  reduced congestion implies reduced vehicle operating costs of having to spend less time on the road.
environmental savings  spending less time on the road is a better outcome for the environment, for example, with less carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.
reduced crash costs  there is an economic cost whenever a crash occurs. therefore, improving road safety by removing trucks off the atlanta-macon corridor will reduce the number of crashes, and therefore reduce the cost of crashes.
costs of the project include:
capital costs  being a 40-mile road, this is a very expensive project, costing an estimated $1.8 billion.
operational and maintenance costs  costs will continue to accumulate over the lifetime of the road.
other issues:
testing infrastructure for self-driving trucks  one of the observed benefits of the project is that the highway will be used to test self-driving trucks. given the uncertainties in this new technology, it may be more worthwhile to consider a smaller-scale project to undertake these tests.
better roads  there are many projects on the horizon for georgia, and the benefits and costs for all of these projects need to be analysed to determine which one will be best for the state at large.
equity  the road project will be paid by taxpayer money; however, the new road will only be usable by truck drivers. is this fair?
based on the implementation of the freight-only tunnel in dublin and dedicated truck-only lanes on american highways using bitre, improvements to the georgia highway could include:
smaller scale project  the effectiveness of projects described in bitre were of much smaller scale with lower costs. a smaller scale version of this project should be considered to help establish early on whether it is something that will work.
other vehicles  the dublin port tunnel allows other vehicles on the road for a toll. this could provide economic benefits to private motorists too, such as travel time savings, whilst providing revenue to help fund the road. this would also relieve equity issues with the road being paid by taxpayer money. if safety is a concern, the road could be separated into truck-only lanes and non-truck lanes, similar to the american highway examples.
if the proposal was considered for victoria, it is important to:
ensure the link is built where freight travel demand is highest, that is, going in and out of the port of melbourne.
ensure the link helps bypass the most heavily congested and vulnerable (residential) areas, that is, the area towards the west of the port, near yarraville.
allow other road users to use the highway in addition to trucks, given the significant economic benefits this would generate for the project.
consider smaller scale projects. industrial areas in melbourne are scattered in different directions across metropolitan melbourne. given trucks will be coming from various directions towards the port, having one large-scale freight corridor is less likely to be useful.

"week 11:
this week i continued working on my literature review. i have tabulated a comparison of some recent demonstrated and high-profile theoretical architectures which calculate/simulate photonic densely-connected neural networks, and photonic convolutional neural networks. 
it may be that both of these require revisiting later on, with more specific values, but as it currently stands, the tables seem to encapsulate the prescient points of each architectural proposal. 
comparing and tabulating these designs took a surprisingly long period of time, as some of the papers did not clearly specify metrics that i was looking for. 
at the beginning of this project i spoke about wanting to compare network bandwidths, and i have come to realise this is especially difficult for these architectures, 
as the bandwidth can be altered by the number of channels available, the modulation rate, the detection rate, the input data rate and a whole host of other issues. 

as a result, it has been replaced by latency and achievable resolution. 
from these, one can get an idea of the processing capabilities of the network, but bandwidth can be higher than these. 
although, in most cases it may not be, as the bandwidth is limited by photodetection rate. 
importantly, some of these architectures list higher bandwidths, but this is due to spatial parallelism, 
and so it is difficult to boil down what the network bandwidth truly is. as a result, a combination of the latency, resolution and fan-in/available channels is a good proxy. 

i also continued thinking of ways to increase the fan-in of each individual neuron/component. 
polarization sensitive microring resonators were demonstrated a couple of years ago, so polarization-division-multiplexing and wavelength-division-multiplexing of signals could boost the input fan-in. 
even just with 2 polarizations (te and tm), this effectively doubles the fan-in of each neuron, provided that tunable-control of te and tm polarization selective mrrs is possible. to my knowledge, tunable control of te mrrs has not been demonstrated, whilst tm mrr control of up to 6 bits i believe has been shown. there is no fundamental/logical reason that springs to mind as to why electro-optic or thermo-optic tuning of these te mrrs is not possible however, so it may just not have been done before. 

other potential methods to increase neuron fan-in involve spatial multiplexing of signals on different, dedicated waveguides, such that each neuron has multiple waveguides. even just 2 waveguides to each neuron substantially increases the complexity of the noc (network-on-chip) design, as waveguide crossings and changes in relative waveguide length are now potentially important factors. however, out-of-plane waveguide crossings may allow for more effective utilisation of the chip area, as they effectively hide the waveguide in another dimension until it is needed. 

with a desired fan-in of more than 1000 unique signals, this is not a trivial task. with a high finesse, low linewidth optical resonator structure as shown in toward ultimate miniaturization of high q silicon traveling-wave microresonators, a fsr of 57 nm was demonstrated with a measured loaded spectral line-width of 115pm, meaning that approximately 57/.115 (this is at least 495) individual signals could be realised in a single wdm waveguide. cascaded (ie 2nd-order) repeated instances of these resonators could further reduce the spectral line-width, but may make effective control of the scaling of these wavelengths difficult, although they could be used to couple the signal onto a separate waveguide which then has a more controllable electro-optic mrr to weight the signal. this again would increase the complexity of the noc, but the tradeoff may be worthwhile. i have not seen any work in thermal or electrical control of these micro-donut resonators, but that may just be due to the relatively new field and lack of current scientific interest in, or academics working on, photonic nocs, or the difficulty in getting funding for such research. of course, as i write this, i realise that channel density is not the only important consideration. the response of a modulator is also vitally important: if these micro-donut resonators cannot transmit data at the high switching frequencies (tens of ghz, if not higher) of other photonic systems, then they will become a bottleneck, and the advantage of having a higher number of channels will be mitigated by slower switching frequencies. trying to optimise this multi-dimensional pareto curve is currently the bane of my existence. 
i also thought about a time-delay neuron, which couples n signals onto a delay track using an electro-optic modulator such as a mrr with peaks at each of the incoming wdm wavelengths. taking the logical minimum of 1 delay line, we can have 2*n effective signals incident on the photodetector. let me explain further: if the photodetector is only incoherently summing individual wavelengths, and the non-linear function occurs electrically (in high speed analogue electronics), then it doesnt matter if signals coherently interfere at the photodetector or beforehand. as a result, we can have two wdm signals coming into the neuron, one at the first timestep and one at the second. couple the first signal (comprising n individual weighted signals) onto the delay line, along which scaling mrrs exist. the second time-domain signal (again comprising n signals) will not be delayed, and scaling mrrs can be along this undelayed waveguide. this will reduce the switching frequency of the mrrs, which may also increase resolution. supporting calculations would be necessary to support this. then the delayed signal is coupled back onto the non-delayed waveguide, such that coherent interference occurs, before the signal hits the photodetector. the photodetector performs an incoherent summation anyways: the input intensity is converted into a single electrical current, so the interference of prior signals will not change the weighted summation. as a result, over 2 time-steps, the photodetector will see essentially no input light on the first time-step, and effectively 2n  signals on the second, increasing fan-in, at the cost of a delay line and switching mechanics. alternatively, the weighting mrrs could exist before the delay line: while this means that the switching of the mrrs needs to be at the time-slot scale or higher, it means that for control over 2*n signals, we only need n individual mrrs. however, this high switching frequency of n mrrs for each neuron may introduce parasitic capacitance and high-heat, resulting in a loss of energy, as well as definitely requiring more complex controlling electronics. 
lastly, i proposed an adjustment to tait et al.s a silicon photonic modulator neuron, that would be fairly simple to implement, and would allow for both continuous valued and spiking dynamics to be realised. i will attach a short explanatory document.
professor lowery has been quite busy recently, so most of my correspondence has been with mike xu, a new member of the ecse faculty working in the optics laboratory. professor lowery said yesterday (23/5/2020) that he is able to do a zoom meeting with me this week, so that is something to look forward to.

"hi joanne,
i would just like to clarify the solutions for question 2d of the w1 tutorial. the solutions give:
min = 305, q1 = 315.5, med = 320, q3 = 325, max = 335.

if i use the =quartile() function in excel, i get slightly different answers for q1 and q3:
q1 = 316, q3 = 324.75.
i noticed that when i plot a box and whisker graph, q1 and q3 can be calculated excluding the median. i believe this is a standard setting because when i initially plotted a standard box and whisker plot, i got the same q1 and q3 as the solutions, but if i change the settings so that q1 and q3 are calculated to includethe median, then i get the same results as when i use =quartile().

can you please confirm what would be the correct method? although the difference is small in this case i would like to make sure i am doing the same as you would for assessed coursework.

"for the progress since week 4:
i have fixed zhao's method's r/t parameter recovery, and added explicit 0-constraints to the off-diagonal blocks based on james' feedback.
i have begun investigating the averaging method (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02663) and produced a summary document, stored in the github repository.
i have also done some background reading on admm, positive semidefinite matrices, and singular value/spectral decompositions.
i have begun wrestling with extending zhao's constraints to multi-view, though did not get particularly far, since (as per the summary document) there is no immediate way to remove the rotation matrix from the consistency constraint.
in this week's meeting, there were several avenues of further exploration discussed:
firstly, the recovery from the consistent n-view essential matrix is not producing the same r/t parameters as is being input to it, and so is likely incorrect; it is worth setting up a realistic scenario and plotting input and output points in order to determine what exactly is happening. this may relate to non-uniqueness of e's decomposition, which should be investigated. it is also worth investigating the physical meaning of ri, ti; whether they are pairwise relative or absolute to a fixed global coordinate system.
investigate various ideas from the two papers (zhao, averaging) to see if there are any nice formulations of analogous x matrices for multi-view; even if a full constraint/objective list cannot be written yet. this may initially focus on n=3 cameras rather than the general case.
additionally, james pointed me to the idea of quaternions to represent rotations; this may prove easier to generalise to multi-view, at the cost of being less elegant and higher computational cost. i will do some background reading and exploring in this space.
further, the above would have a polynomial of degree 4 in its objective function, and so polynomial optimisation / sum of squares relaxations may prove useful. james has linked a book on this, particularly in chapters 2-3, https://sites.math.washington.edu/~thomas/frg/frgbook/siambookfinalvnov12-2012.pdf

"why is jakarta sinking?
jakarta is the capital city of indonesia, located on the island of java. since the 1970s, the city has been steadily sinking. parts of the city have already sunk four metres, with different parts sinking at rates between 1-25cm per year, depending on the report. the reason for the extreme sinking is due to a combined effect from the rising sea levels caused by the climate crisis, and over-extracting groundwater, leading to land subsidence

what is the challenge and how does it relate to groundwater?
despite the extensive flooding issues jakarta is known to face, it is the lack of water supply in the megacity that is at the root of its subsidence issues. poor water delivery and water infrastructure to much of the city, with up to 40% of citizens having no access to piped water at all, means that many jakartans have sunk boreholes into their properties to get their own water. decades of this unregulated and uncontrolled groundwater extraction, coupled with a decreasing amount of permeable surfaces across the city - preventing groundwater recharge - means that the groundwater level has significantly dropped and with it, the soil surface.

what are some of the current solutions currently discussed?
based on an inspection in may 2018, 56 out of 80 buildings had their own groundwater pump, with 33 extracting water illegally. due to this, a solution being discussed is the issuing of licences for buildings to extract groundwater. this would limit the number of extractions whilst also giving authorities an indication of how much groundwater is being extracted.
another current solution being undertaken is the construction of the great garuda. the great garuda is a 32km sea wall which is being built around jakarta bay to prevent the flooding of the islands.
replacement is also a solution being discussed where people are still allowed to extract groundwater, but must replace the amount extracted. this could be done by the biopori method where a hole is dug, 10cm in diameter and 100cm deep, into the ground to allow water to be reabsorbed into the soil. another method of replacement is called artificial recharge, where expensive technology is used to replace groundwater deep at its source.
there were also other extreme solutions of completely halting the extraction of groundwater and solely relying on other sources of water, such as from rivers or man-made reservoirs. this could work, however it could take up to 10 years to clean up the rivers, dams and lakes to allow water to be piped anywhere or used as a replacement for the aquifers deep underground.
another extreme solution was the relocation of the capital of indonesia to a new location.",1,M,ENGLISH

progress:i have investigated the different baseline models used by numerous few shot learning. the most common seems to be using a distance metric for the classifier such as cosine similarity. another used by chen et al. 2020 involved training on cross-entropy loss but then using a method they created named cosine nearest-centroid. this involved removing the last fully connected layer of the classifier and then getting the average feature of a given samples in a novel class. afterwards, they classify the query sample using cosine distance. links to the relevant articles can be found on the attached powerpoint.

"bim maturity levels define the extent to which across the dimensions of technology, organisation and process, the level of information exchange and collaboration (sacks et al. 2018) .  at bim level 2, the objective is to attain a managed collaborative working environment with targeted points of engagement in relation to specific data, groups, or activities as required to best manage specific focus areas. for example, sharing of object-based models between two or more disciplines. this requires interoperable data and technologies to most effectively exchange the data required to enable this collaboration.  further, at bim level 3, the objective is to attain a fully integrated working environment that is seamless and does not require user interventions to facilitate data exchange or collaboration between user groups contributing to or utilising that data.
where interoperability is inadequate, the benefits of utilisation and leveraging from common data sets is significantly diminished due to delayed data transfer between different software systems arising from the need to convert data to meet other system format requirements.  also, captured data definition or resolution may not meet the requirements of other systems or may be impacted by data conversion and bring an increased potential for data errors introduced through additional data processing (sacks et al. 2018) (cashin et al. 2018 ).  these issues present an obstacle of time, additional effort and risk that do not support the collaboration and integration objectives of bim maturity levels 2 and 3, and thus illustrate the criticality of interoperable data.

"hi all,
the brt i am aware of had full height platform screen doors in one of the cities where i came from.  the psds added extra comfort amenity for passenger by providing a good shelter type protection in enclosed environment on extreme weather days.  it also acts as a barrier from direct contact with the expose to vehicle exhaust.
delhi experience initially was to ease the traffic, but from the news it was hunted by the reliability issues.  it provides lesson learnt to other brt projects where the reliability is the key and from my observation delhi did not further fine tune its brt priority signals.  a good priority signal would increase the willingness from the public to shift the commuting method.  
theres always pros and cons of the brt system.  for the advantages, we can see brt has a more flexibility in terms of mobility in the network, they can simply go anywhere if roads are big enough and available.  brt also embraces the benefit of lower maintenance cost with less wayside infrastructures need to maintain.   for example, there is no need for dedicated track maintenance, and if brt vehicle is self-powered, there is no need to include substations and catenary systems.  the size of brt maintenance depot is also smaller compare to light rails depots, which can see as an advantage for places that need to fight for land use.  the overall maintenance of the brt vehicle  is also cheaper considering the steel wheels cost more than rubber tires and the steel wheels are non-permanent assets they still require re-profiling from time to time until a new set is being put on.
light rail is limited to its guided tracks which may seem a disadvantage in terms of mobility, but there is an advantage if we look at it from a slightly different point of view.  the limitation of the guideway means the road users would know exactly where the light rail vehicles are - staying on its track.  except for derailing scenarios which dont normally occur, the majority of the time we know exactly where and how the light rail vehicles would move.  on normal road, if a safe distance is setup between the light rail vehicle to other vehicles, the drivers of other vehicles would behave differently compare to next to a bus.  also, if the town centre planning decided to introduce a pedestrian only zone, a guided rail system would benefit as we can easily setup a  safety clearance area for the light rail vehicle to travel.  moreover, lrt is preferable these days as we see more vehicles are equipped with on-board batteries which can power in between stations without the overhead catenary wires or embedded induction loops.  some of them se lithium ion batteries and some of them use super capacitors.  this can tidy up the looks of our city landscape.",1,M,MANDARIN

"this week my focus was on two tasks:

creating quantifiable measures for a voc sensors performance.

designing a pcb for the mimic head for the new electronics design for the atmo biosciences capsule.

creating the frameworks for several quantifiable measures of a voc sensor's performance and coding tools which calculated these results. 

in order to better characterise the performance of different voc sensors i have been tasked with developing quantifiable performance measures which allow a device's performance to be evaluated numerically rather than requiring a human interpretation.

the three measures which i have developed are:

repeatability

see previous discussions about repeatability matrices. repeatability summarizes these matrices into a single value.

step drift

step response

whilst these measures are not at the core of my project (pid control for constant voc sensor heater temperature) they will provide an important framework for assessing the performance of voc sensors once pid control has been established.

step drift - how stable is a voc sensor within a specific gas step?

the gradient curve of the voc 50.00 response within each gas step is calculated.

note: analysis only included gas steps which had 0% hydrogen or 0.1% hydrogen as sensor stability was much lower in these gas steps, and these steps also occur towards the beginning of the calibration cycle.


gradient is calculated as (change in voc reading) / (change in time (seconds)). i.e. adc units / second.
for example, this is the gradient of the 2nd gas step for capsule 24 is shown below:

the first 15 minutes of the gas step are excluded from analysis to decouple the sensor response to a gas change from the drift within a step.

the average gradient of all gradients within a gas step excluding the first 15 mins is calculated as is the standard deviation of all gradients within this gas step. the result is two tables for each capsule.

gas states / mean gradients

in this table, the first entry 0.020906 represents the mean gradient of the gradient shown in the graph above for all measurements after the first 15mins (in 1.c.)

gas states / standard deviation





once this table has been created, the values are averaged to create two values which represent step drift for a capsule.

mean step drift = average(abs(mean step drift gradients)) e.g. for capsule 24 this is 0.053.


mean standard deviation = stddev.p(step drift standard deviations) e.g. for capsule 24 this is 0.266.


step response
step response is aiming to measure how quickly a capsule is responding to a gas step change.
note: this analysis includes all gas steps, not just steps where h2 is 0% or 0.1% as was the case during the step drift calculation. data was however filtered to remove any rows which did not have gas state data or within which all gas channels were set to 0.
1.   the gradient is calculated for each gas step
a.   an example step gradient:

b.   next the mean and standard deviation of each gas step gradient are calculated. the mean and standard deviation are used to determine the values which sit outside +-1.6 std deviations from the mean.
c.   the last measurement which falls outside of this envelope is noted. the time between this measurement and the first measurement within the gas step is deemed the response time for that gas step.
i.
ii.in this case, the response time is 0 as the gradient never leaves +-1.6 std deviations from the mean. (not the y axis scale).

d.   the response times for each gas step are averaged to determine a step response time measure for a capsule.
designing a pcb for the mimic head for the new electronics design for the atmo biosciences capsule.
currently a new version of the electronics is being developed for the atmo capsule. in order to test the new design the electronics are first assembled in a development board format. the board that i have designed (called a mimic head) houses several different sensors and provides a platform for these sensors to be tested in the rmit gas lab. the mimic head is designed to be plugged into the development board and provide a platform for various gas sensors to be housed and exposed to the testing gas stream. whilst this board is not directly related to my project, it will ensure that the pid control for constant temperature on the voc sensor heater will be able to be tested and developed on the new version of the electronics. 
the sensor board is quite small (17mm diameter) and has been designed to have the potential to mount 5 different gas sensors and a temperature and humidity sensor. as demonstrated in the figure below, this design is quite space constrained - so it was quite a challenge to complete the layout. this was also the first time i have used altium - it was great to get some experience using a tool which is so prevalent in industry. 
one of the challenges associated with this design is that the pin out of the posifa tcd sensor which is being used in the capsule hardware has changed between different revisions of the sensor. consequently the board that i have designed includes 0 ohm resistor banks which, depending on the load configuration, allow either sensor pin out to be used. 
the board layout: 
the overall design. the sensor board is connected to a connector by a long flexible pcb segment.

"why is the west gate tunnel in melbourne delayed?
the west gate tunnel is currently being built in melbourne and is designed to be a 4km toll road which will link the west gate freeway at yarraville to the port of melbourne. two tunnel boring machines were being used to construct the tunnel however construction has been delayed due to the discovery of contaminated soil.

what is the challenge and how does it relate to groundwater?
soil beneath the west gate tunnel is contaminated with chemicals including pfas and asbestos. these substances are waste from historical industrial action. after the tunnel boring machine starts digging dirt and rock, all the contaminated soil has to be separated and safely stored on site before transported to treatment facilities yet the treatment plants are not capable of handling large amounts of contaminated soil. the discovery of the chemical waste from the industrial works to the soil beneath west gate tunnel shows that they flow through the soil and could possibly be carried by the groundwater.

solutions?
possible solutions include;

multiple large scale storage facilities may be needed to store the soil


the soil can be transported to treatment plants to remove the chemicals - however currently these facilities dont have enough capacity to handle the influx of soil


an enormous new landfill site could be created and lined with specific fabric to store the soil.

"facts always beat insults
this opinion piece, written by andrew bolt, is a direct response to an article written by tim flannery (chief councillor at the climate council), and serves as almost an attack. bolt completely dismisses flannerys article as the death of reason, and labels flannerys overall contribution to the climate discussion as an extraordinary record of false claims.
bolt makes it very clear from the outset that he does not buy into claims about the possible extreme negative impacts that climate change and global warming can have, and makes what could be classified as an attack on tim flannery and his scientific work. bolt completely dismisses climate science as alarmist and instead prioritises what he thinks and believes about what will happen, regardless of scientific backing.
bolts article is outstandingly biased, and shows how extremely entrenched he is in his hard-line denial of the impact of climate change. statistics and arguments are cherry-picked to support his view, ignoring the further context and any facts that dont support his opinion. this serves to completely alienate readers against the broader message put forward by scientists and ngos that climate change is an emergency that requires immediate action. he also misquotes and overstates comments made against him by flannery, interpreting comments labelling him as a climate predator as being (likened) to a paedophile. this misrepresentation of flannerys points presents bolt as the victim, further dismissing the article he is responding to.
whilst bolt does present statistics that are generally factual, they are presented in a manner that seems to completely prove his point, instead of exploring the reasons behind. predictions of future trends are hinged on their immediate outcomes, citing a decrease in cyclones from 2015 to 2016 as proof that cyclones have not occurred more frequently in the future. furthermore, bolt condemns the desalination plants build on flannerys recommendation as a failure, despite them future-proofing australias freshwater supply. he also rubbishes claims that pacific islands would be drowned by rising sea levels, referencing that fact that tuvalus overall size has increased by 2.9 percent. rmit abc fact check determined that whilst these claims are true, the reason for the increase in size is not due to sea level changes, but rather due to sedimentation. in truth, tuvalus sea level has risen 15cm in the past 4 decades, and the future possibility of mass loss is unclear, especially in places like the solomon islands where the sea level has risen 7-10mm per year over 1994-2014. whilst the article does contain some facts and statistical analysis, to say that it accurately considered the technical and scientific issues involved would be a stretch.
bolt does not attempt to present a reasoned and balanced analysis, rather opting to completely dismiss any predictions or scientific analysis that does not back his view that climate change is not at all a problem. he deliberately focusses on the shortcomings of predictions of possible outcomes, and omits anything that would counter his claims.

frequency in the grid must be kept constant
in australia electricity is provided at 50 hz
when you turn on a light, overall frequency drops a little bit, so more energy must be provided to the grid to keep the electricity supply at 50 hz
inertia is the ability of an electrical supply system to keep electricity at a constant frequency, by starting or stopping generation in real time, in response to how much electricity is being used
inertia should come from sources that are easily switched on and off, like nuclear or hydro

"what is the the great artesian basin?
the great artesian basin is an extremely large aquifer under the australian landmass. it covers around 22% of the area of the australian continent and spans across four states and territories. sandstone, existing beneath sea level, was pushed upwards during the formation of the australian continent. this sandstone was itself saturated with seawater, and was then covered over by impermeable geological layers. a large body of water was therefore contained under the ground surface through these areas- this is the source of the observed salinity in the water.
many mines and regional communities draw on the aquifer as a water source. proper management of the aquifer involves staggering use in order to maintain positive pressure - reducing the cost and effort of pumping water into communities and mining operations. the aquifer is recharged via the entry of freshwater, which enters through a relatively small recharge zone in nsw and qld, and typically flows towards the south and west. this process is very slow in comparison to the very large intake of seawater that occurred during the aquifers formation.
early in the 20th century, it became evident that water pressure in the great artesian basin was dissipating due to large-scale tapping/borehole drilling. to combat the increasing depletion that was occurring in the basin, the government introduced regulation to improve the use of uncontrolled extraction of groundwater. this involved the upgrading of obsolete bore systems, retiring unnecessary pumps and improvement of the water flow network. proper use and interaction with the basin is outlined in the great artesian basin strategic management plan 2018. this initiative resulted in a significant reduction in water consumption from the basin per year.
misuse of the basin, aside from causing losses in water availability, is responsible for the spread of pests in the landscape, as well as increasing salinity surface level water and land mass.
why is the west gate tunnel in melbourne delayed
the tunneling of the west gate tunnel has been delayed due to the soil contamination with a chemical such as asbestos and pfas that shut down the fiskville cfa training college.the tunnel boring machines digging up the thousands of cubic metres of dirt and rock would require any contaminated soil to be separated and safely stored on site before being transported. as a result, the delay would be due to this process in culmination with the issue that the treatment plants currently do not have the capacity to handle the large amount of contaminated soil expected to come their way.
this has relevance to groundwater as there are geotechnical investigations that have to be conducted before the drilling of the tunnel and hence, would involve the testing of samples and perhaps a groundwater monitoring well installed for the collection and measurement of groundwater levels. a solution to this issue would be to drill deeper in order to avoid the contaminated soil. however, this in itself poses other problems.
why is jarkarta sinking?
60% of jarkarta residents use groundwater as a source of water. the dramatic rate at which jarkarta is sinking is partly due to the excessive extraction of groundwater for use as drinking water, bathing and other everyday purposes by city dwellers. as a result, individuals there have no choice but to resort to pumping water from aquifers deep underground. when this groundwater is pumped out, the land above sinks, leading to land subsidence, causing infrastructure to sink. this could cause floods to become worse as the water can't flow into the ocean. in some places in jarkarta, it has sunk by up to 4m since 1970.
solutions would include halting all groundwater extraction and solely rely on other sources of water such rain or river water or piped water from man-made reservoirs. jarkarta must do this by 2050 to avoid major subsidence.

"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-shifting-from-fossil-fuels-to-cleaner-alternatives-will-require-fossil-fuels/
critique of ""why shifting from fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives will require fossil fuels""
in the article published on the 29th of june, 2011, david biello strongly dismisses the possibility of a ""clean revolution"" that requires no ""greenhouse gas-emitting, mountain-levelling, air-polluting, fossil-fuel burning way of life"" using expert's opinions. biello believes that emerging towards a clean revolution is impractical and naive, as ""fossil fuel energy is so cheap"". he supported his ostensible statement with vaclav smil's expert opinion from the university of manitoba, quoting that ""energy is dirt cheap."" biello continues to explain that other forms of sustainable energy requires fossil fuels to gather the resources in the first place, effectively defeating the clean revolution's purpose. overall, biello clearly expressed his anger and frustration in others' effort to switch to sustainable energy and is constantly insinuating in his article that idea is futile.
biello addresses smil's speak at the recent equinox summit regarding the plan to devise a new energy scenario for 2030 and concluded that it is impractical to build power plants to harvest energy from hot rocks to solar battery combos. he appears to be unsupportive towards the sustainable option, as even the simplest components like steel and cement requires coal to be burned, and the same scenario applies to cheap plastic photovoltaics require polymers made from oil. however, despite biello's constant effort to dismiss the sustainable ideas, he failed to suggest a pragmatic solution to the problem, thus rendering his article fairly biased.
biello constantly uses expert's opinion to capture his readers' attention but fails to support his arguments with appropriate statistical data. quoting vague claims like ""we're not running out of anything on a human scale"" to argue that coal is not running out is not only misleading but also unprofessional, as it is supposedly said by professor vaclav smil.
ultimately, biello switches to intimidate the tax payers by pointing out that ""tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and a dead zone in the gulf of mexico"" went into farmig ethanol from corn. he asserts that ""we should focus our resources and attention on what has the best chance to succeed"" and later pointed out ""that's not biofuels. it is pv."" the abbreviation is poorly used in the context, however, biello soon after cleared the confusions by explaining that pv stands for photovoltaic modules. overall, biello has clearly explained why he does not support the energy system reform proposal but fails to suggest pragmatic solutions to the energy crisis.",1,F,VIETNAMESE

1. should a linkedin profile be hyperlinked if it is not fully set-up? the criteria suggests no but it doesn't really make sense, we are submitting a resume &amp; cover letter, not a linkedin profile.
2. font - ""must not use creative or elaborate borders/colours/formats"" - pretty vague here. i have included a screen clip below of my resume, please tell me if you deem it too creative or elaborate (career connect strongly advised me to use a more interesting &amp; professional template than the one used in their slides for john patakis).
3. personal information: ""includes name, address, phone, mobile, fax, email"" - there is a box for no fax in the explanatory notes. do you want a fax number or not? hopefully no as it is so outdated.
4. skills - explanatory notes has a box for""key skills summary after career objective (optional)"". does this mean the skills section is optional or its positioning is optional?
career connect advised against a skills section altogether and said your skills should already be summarised under your employment entries using the 'power verb + transferable skill + qualitative outcome' formula mentioned in the employment section of the rubric.
5. skills - explanatory notes mention listing personal attributes. is this optional?
again, career connect adivse against this and suggest the information should be woven into the resume elsewhere.

"critique of why is australia trying to shut down climate activism?
damien cave and livia albeck-ripka try to investigate the reasons behind australias attempt to shut down climate activism, yet it is a country that is intimately associated with coal mining. the authors offer a background to some of the notable protest cases in the country, whereby a single activist halted raining services by tying himself to the tracks. in other cases, protesters have caused a gridlock by closing some of the busiest roads in sydney, and the government has responded with threats that it may introduce laws meant to prevent such protests. the authors also offer a justification for such an upsurge in protests, insisting that the country is far behind in its commitment to cut down greenhouse emissions, and this amounts to an abandonment of the paris agreement that was abandoned earlier by the trump administration as well. they remain fair and balanced in their writing, referring to the beginning of such climate change wars. according to the authors, most of these emission reduction wars mostly featured in election campaigns, but now they are turning into the streets and manifesting in the most notable protests that the country has ever experienced. they also refer to other countries, stating that there are nations which have experienced climate change protests before, but australia stands out because it is determined to quell any forms of activism.
while the article appears balanced, most of the information stands out as mere assertions because it is not backed up by facts and statistical data. the authors report that the forces behind climate change activism in australia have their roots in national identity, a growing rift between the public and government opinion, as well as the economics of climate change, but there is no statistical information detailing how climate change initiatives have changed and shaped the country over time. the authors also state that australia is full of coal-loving politicians, but it is not clear whether they own coal-mining companies, have shares in some of these companies, or are simply adamant in passing the kind of legislation that would outlaw or at least slow down the rate of coal mining in the country. 
beyond the absence facts, the article covers the topic extensively, and there is no missing information. for instance, the authors review the assertions used by scientists in fighting coal mining activities if at all there are any hopes of mitigating the effects of climate change. damien cave and livia albeck-ripka believe that australia is the biggest exporter of coal globally and besides, it exports large amounts of natural gas. whereas this continues to nourish the economy, the country continues getting dumb. after leaving office, some of the law makers associate themselves with the coal-mining industry, and this is why the government is keen on banning activism. a survey that was conducted by the australian institute indicated that 81% of the people in australia fear that climate change brought along by coal mining and the burning of fossil fuel will only bring more floods and drought, and the benefits accruing from such incidences may not be offset by the economic benefits of coal mining. the balance and objectivity expressed in the article makes it legitimate, albeit with the missing statistical information to support some assertions.

"for activity 2, i would like you to explore a tier 2 strategy for a student who is not responsive to tier 1. you may choose to do this in any number of ways, eg:

select a strategy from the simonsen and sugai (2019) reading, or


select and explore a strategy from the tier 2 strategies outlined at https://www.pbisworld.com/tier-2/, or


focus on the most commonly-used tier 2 strategy: check-in-check-out. you can find out more here:http://www.pbisworld.com/tier-2/check-in-check-out-cico.

discussion prompt:once you have selected your strategy, i would like to you respond to the second moodle forum, describing a student you have taught/observed for whom your selected strategy would be a useful alternative to existing procedures in your school or centre. explain the challenging behaviour exhibited by this student and what data is collected by the school/centre on these types of behaviours. describe the current system for responding to this behaviour. explain why you selected the strategy that you chose for this student and how it would provide a better alternative.
there are a number of students within my primary school context who are in need of extra support due to difficulties with behaviour and who would benefit from small group, targeted social skills instruction that promotes pro-social behaviours.the schools systematic collection of accurate data from both classrooms and the school yard, continually demonstrates that these students have difficulty understanding non-verbal social cues, and interpreting body language and facial expressions during social interactions, often resulting in verbal altercations and sometimes escalating to physical aggression.
this year, we are fortunate enough to have two experienced teachers released for two days per week to customise and facilitate targeted, small social skills groups.using the school-wide behaviour data, approximately 20 students were identified as having an increasing number of incidents recorded.these students were discussed during a meeting with school leadership and the social skills group teachers, and grouped according to the specific behaviour to be reduced or eliminated.these groupings were then distributed to each grade level teaching team so that teachers could collaborate and discuss their observations of these students, and to report any antecedents or triggers to their behaviours.
each group contains 2-4 students, who meet for 30-minute sessions twice per week to participate in lessons where they receive explicit instruction, modelling of replacement behaviours, and then acknowledgement and reinforcement when they display the replacement skills.the students often role-play a non-example of the expected behaviour first and then the appropriate example after it.these are usually recorded via ipad (provided students are willing) and they then watch the clips and are provided feedback by both the teacher and the other group members to alleviate any misrules they may have had.with the group members permission, these videos are then also used during whole-school social skills lessons as exemplars of appropriate, replacement behaviours.
after a relatively short period of 6 weeks (due to extended school holidays and the current covid-19 restrictions), these students had already begun demonstrating a slight decrease in the number of incidents reported, growth in the number of aspire tickets received and increased opportunity to spend at the aspire market.this provides us with cautious optimism, that with continued participation in the tier 2 intervention, an increase in engagement of on task behaviour and a decrease in disruptive behaviours will be reported.",1,F,ENGLISH

"week 7
from putting an end to end-to-end: gradient-isolated learning of representations https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11786.pdf, they found the following:

""""""
cpc takes a bag x = {zt+k, zj1 , zj2 , ...zjn1 } for each delay k, with one positive sample zt+k which is the encoding of the input that follows k time-steps after ct, and n  1 negative samples zjn which are uniformly drawn from all available encoded input sequences.

for the self-supervised training using the infonce objective, we need to contrast the predictions of the model for its future representations against negative samples. we draw these samples uniformly at random from across the input batch that is being evaluated. thus, the negative samples can contain samples from the same image at different patch locations, as well as from different images. we found that including the positive sample (i.e. the future representation that is currently to be predicted) in the negative samples did not have a negative effect on the final performance
""""""

allowing the positive sample to be included in the negative samples meant that instead of calculating the loss of each prediction individually, all predictions in a batch can be done in one matrix multiplication. this led to a x5 speed improvement, from 46 per batch to 9s per patch, with the prediction and loss calculations taking only 0.01s per batch (32 images per batch, 16 negative samples for loss, 5 prediction steps)
after making this change it turned out that cpc had been training all along but had been doing it too slow that i had never let it run long enough.
the goal for next week is to improve the time taken for the encoder to run (it seems to be taking 10x longer than it should be), and then i can provide exact measures on cpc performance.",1,M,ENGLISH

sophie: good example of zpd and scaffolding. guides the children to increase their vocabulary through a picturebookcathy: helped engage the children through gestures with the picture bookleah: starts the structured sentence but doesn't finishes it the entire sentence, allowing the children to engage in completing the sentence from the picture book by yelling out.
vocabulary is a key concept to develop for primary school students (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). according to bridie (2001), 'students start school at age 5, they have acquired a large amount of knowledge about language'. primary school children develop knowledge in language from home talk, which provides familiarity, social relationships and creates intention (bridie, 2001). 
the three videos represented an easy level of challenge towards the young children, which is most appropriate for building vocabulary (biemiller and biemiller, 2006). all of the teachers use direct explanation (biemiller and biemiller, 2006), as they read the story out loud and engage the children to interact. this also relates to the social constructivism concept by vygotsky, by utilising social interaction to drive learning, knowledge and talk (bridie, 2001).
bridie (2001) suggests that teachers need to have patience and address different capabilities. all three teachers show interaction in small groups, of three or more children, reading out loud a picturebook. leah starts reading a sentence and then waits for the children to yell out the last word of green eggs and ham, by dr. suess. leah would sometimes lose her patience slightly, by finishing the sentence before each child has yelled out the response. bridie (2001) also explains that encouraging feedback will engage their actions and attentiveness. leah didn't respond with any feedback throughout the video, she instead continued to read the book in what seemed rushed.
in the video with cathy, she used gestures throughout the reading of the picturebook, which encouraged the children to have claws and wave. this is a good example of incorporating interaction and creating new knowledge (bridie, 2001).
sophie demonstrates the use of scaffolding well. according to winch, johnston, march, ljungdahl and holliday (2020), scaffolding refers to 'support given to students through explicit teaching of skills and knowledge, to move students to a higher level of understanding'. she gives the students opportunities to speak and extend their language. she also shows a lot of support and positive feedback, which makes the students feel practical and useful (bridie, 2001).

'changes to drylands with future climate change '
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200403115119.htm
on the 3rdofapril 2020, tina hilding, addressed the issue of drylands in her article, changes to drylands with future climate change. in hildings article, she takes an informative approach to say that because of future climate change and drylands around the world increasing at an accelerated rate, their average productivity will be reduced. she continues to assert that drylands(41% of earths land surface), being an important key in the global carbon cycle and supporting almost 38% of the earths population, are more vulnerable to severe climate extremes. she also adds that regardless of drylands replacing more productive ecosystems, the overall productivity of the lands may not increase due to expected changes in precipitation and temperatures. this is seen to affect the constantly growing population that is supported by drylands, composing of grasslands and shrublands, that are important for supporting grazing and non-irrigated croplands.

in addition to that, she mentions that expansion among different types of drylands will lead to large changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland productivity. she invokes that due to changes in temperature and precipitation, these regions are most threatened as they are already water-stressed. she then adds that frequent and severe droughts also threaten their biodiversity as well as their ability to take in and hold carbon, disrupting the carbon cycle in general. hilding references that developing countries will be hit harder by the degradation of the dryland ecosystems because they hugely depend on these lands as a source of livelihood. she then backs up her argument by citing examples of areas where these changes have been seen to take place in the last few decades, in the u.s. southwest, the introduction of invasive species has changed dryland regions from green to brown. precipitation changes in australia, which is composed almost entirely of drylands, have meant a dryer continent with dramatic impacts and mongolia's grasslands have deteriorated because of warmer temperatures, less rainfall, and overgrazing. she also mentions the critical role that is played in carbon cycling by drylands and how plants facilitate the circulation of carbon dioxide by absorbing it every spring as the plants grow and exuding it out in the fall as they become dormant. she also mentions that drylands cause the most impact on year-to-year changes in the carbon cycle. hilding continues to assert that understanding the role that drylands play in future carbon cycling helps researchers regulate the preservation of areas of high carbon uptake.

hilding finishes her article by contending that as a society, we are not paying much attention to dryland areas. she is however positive that when measures are put into place and a global action plan involving stringent management and sustainable utilization of drylands is urgently implemented, the fragile ecosystems and drylands will be protected from further desertification for climate change mitigation over the next couple of decades.

completed and submitted literature review
final product of literature review on the technologies listed in previous post was 39 pages of text, felt this was way too long for a literature review so worked on condensing the report so that it wasn't an individual assessment of different techniques, methods and implementations but rather a summary of the most relevant parts that were best applied to this project.
ended up with 10 pages, felt all the parts in there were much more relevant and rather than diving in depth into each of the different parts of the workflow it provides a summary of the optimal workflow for developing a predictive maintenance system.
plan to use the bulk of the report that was not included in the literature in the design specification as it is more fitting in there.

performance of the psoc 5lp doesn't allow it to meet timing requirements for digital signal processing (not fast enough and no hardware dsp block, many of the dsp element are just implemented in software)
hence either psoc 5lp will just have to be used for data acquisition and simple filtering tasks, and then off-load data to a more powerful mcu, sbc such as a stm32h7 line, raspberry pi, nvidia jetson, etc. will have to do some more research into this.


next week:

start laying out document.

project work
start develop simscape/simulink model of spm tws 600s hd well service pump.
develop cad model of pump, required for multibody simulation.

"meeting agenda:
project progress:

brainstorming ideas for project scope 


installing ros (dual boot / virtual machine) 


completing ros tutorials 


completing moodle literature review modules 


literature review 

project scope:

idea 1: outdoor navigation between buildings around the university. considerations: pedestrians? obstractions? terrain? mapping methods?


idea 2: joining traffic at intersections in a socially acceptable manner. considerations: does a robot give way? how will pedestrians react to an entering robot?


idea 3: navigating through high traffic areas with dynamic obstacles. considerations: non-pedestrian traffic: bikes / skateboards / groups? dynamic obstructions?

assessment requirements:

moodle journal: level of detail, frequency, starting date and submission requirements.


risk assessment: how to apply s.a.r.a.h.


literature review: does this need to be presented in a formal way?


meeting discussion:
working off-campus:

its possible to work on the project without access to the robot by focusing on simulation. create gitlab accounts to get access to previous simulation work.

project scope:

idea 1: potential focus is enabling the robot to understand and perceive the scene it is looking at (cross-reference between the real-world and map, understand information such as building signs and road signs).


idea 2: this may require a narrow pathway with lots of people. generally the pathways in a university campus are large enough to accommodate pedestrians and robot. idea may be more suited for indoor hallways.


idea 3: consider group surfing work, and previous research controlling a robot using deep reinforcement learning. other research has looked at pedestrian tracking and or clustering pedestrians as groups.

assessment:

moodle journal: create a shared document for meeting minutes and copy these meeting notes into moodle posts. it can be in simple point form. clarify with jonathan li about submission of journal posts.


risk analysis: use a past students work as an example.


literatury review: create a shared document for notes and investigate the authors findings.

next steps:

establish a clear objective and goal for the final year project by the next week meeting.

"this week for my fyp i met with mehrtash to discuss the progress of my project and the next steps to take in my fyp. during this meeting we discussed future work for the project, the main ideas that were brought up included training the model to improve performance when it came to image inpainting; writing a script to perform super resolution on an inputted video and further video enhancement techniques.
the main progress in terms of my fyp this week was the deployment of the super resolution web app using heroku. a lot of research, as well as trial and error was required to get the web app up and running (see: http://super-res.herokuapp.com/). although the current web app that has been deployed seems to perform the main task of super resolution, there is still a lot of work required to fix certain bugs and issues with the program. the main issue is the way in which images are stored when it comes to performing the super resolution forward pass on an image and the storage of previous results. the image to be processed is currently stored locally on the server, however this is an error-prone solution as it may cause storage issues or problems when multiple users are using the web app.
the next tasks i plan to work on include fixing the numerous issues with the web app and look into writing a script to perform super resolution on a video.",1,M,ENGLISH

"whoa, those collision diagrams are tough! trying to work out which directions combined with the dca codes can be tricky!
for intersection a:
crash map attached.
1)most common crash type is 121, with 3 crashes. but as a group, the 110s (adjacent directions) have 5 crashes.
2)i would say the primary cause of these crashes are drivers failing to give way. (except for crash 9).
3)changes:
i think there would be confusion between the stop and give way controls, leaving drivers unsure of who has right of way. a low cost treatment would be to remove the give way control for georgina grove (aaron ave is listed as the minor road, so it should keep its stop control). this should remove the confusion of which road should stop/give way. care must be taken to ensure motorists are made aware that there have been changes to these controls.
another possible treatment would be to investigate whether a roundabout could be installed. roundabouts improve safety for vehicles at intersections as they control speed (thereby reducing severity of crashes) and also reduce the number of possible conflict points between vehicles.

ive always found hands on experiments interesting, but it has always been really hard for me to explain scientific concepts, using the right jargon within the context. there was this french show i loved to watch growing up (cest pas sorcier)its not rocket science, which talked about various scientific events from our daily life. the presenter would use start the show with a question to raise awareness on a particular topic and throughout the show he would interview people (quite often experts) and make an experiments to answer the scientific question. i was always fascinated of how he could bring so much clarity to complex scientific phenomenon through visual re-enactment and clearly explaining what was actually happening. as much as i loved that show, in class i always struggled to keep up with science and always found myself struggling to memorise scientific terms for exams. i found the whole process wasextremely difficult and tedious. i was with no surprise that i dropped science for art and languages studies later on in high school.",1,F,FRENCH

"this week i decided to reflect on a specific school policy implementation i have experienced. it centred around improving teaching and learning in the classroom.
staff were asked to work in small groups and visit each others classes to observe the teaching and learning environment and provide detailed feedback. they were encouraged to team up with teachers outside of their subject areas. often the groups were across multiple years levels giving teachers the chance to see the classroom practice in year levels very different from their own experiences.
this was a new initiative and the response from staff was extremely varied. some embraced it right from the start while others were more reluctant to be involved. the negative responses centred around impact it would have in the classroom and concerns with how the information from the visiting teachers was going to be used. some felt it was an accountability measure while others thought it was a form of performance review and there would be follow up (and potential consequences) for those seen as not performing at the expected standard. having other teachers in a class as observers was quite confronting to some staff. for many it had not happened since they were doing their teaching rounds! emotions ranged from being nervous, excited, reluctant, enthusiastic and worried.
it was important for the leadership to acknowledge the concerns of teachers, and how they were feeling, rather than simply dismiss them and impose the new expectations. instead of demanding that the teachers conduct the classroom walks without further discussion, we saw it as vital that the leadership articulated the reasons for the program and recognised the differentaffectsthe initiative was having on teachers. we prioritised informing all staff of the reasons why these classroom walks were being implemented (its a wonderful form of professional development and it improves us all as teachers). the issue of feedback also needed to be addressed because how feedback from the observations would be given and how the information gathered would be used was an area of concern for some. 
key areas of concern were addressed with staff and clear explanations of the process and benefits were communicated. some of these included: visits would only be for about 10 minutes and any observations would be non-judgemental. it was not a performance review and feedback would be given as a group working together as a group. the timing of the visits was organised within the group so there were no unscheduled observations. teachers were encouraged to speak to the students of in classes about the upcoming visits. this normalised the process and students became used to other teachers visiting
recognising that teachers wereaffectedin different ways, and the leadership addressing these concerns, was central to these classroom walks being embedded into the learning culture of the school. those supportive of the idea from the start became leaders within the groups and this developed their leadership skills. staff have enjoyed observing classes, subjects and year levels they do not teach. trust has developed amongst teachers and the feedback is constructive and therefore valued.",1,M,ENGLISH

i'm a bit confused about the variable ntime and how we use it in the code to plot the solution. i understand reshape is needed to convert the vector to a 2d matrix but why do we need ntime in there and how do we use it while using reshape?
